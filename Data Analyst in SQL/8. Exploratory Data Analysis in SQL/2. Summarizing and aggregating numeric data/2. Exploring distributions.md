# 1. Exploring distributions

Understanding the distribution of a variable is crucial for finding errors, outliers, and other anomalies in the data.

# 2. Count values

For columns with a small number of discrete values, we can view the distribution by counting the number of observations with each distinct value. We group by, and order the results by, the column of interest. There are 20 distinct values in the unanswered_count column in the stackoverflow data with the tag amazon-ebs. Only partial results are shown here. Twenty values are manageable to examine, but when the variable you're interested in takes on many different values, binning or grouping the values can make the output more useful.

# 3. Truncate

One way to do this is with the trunc function. Trunc is short for truncate. The trunc function reduces the precision of a number. This means replacing the smallest numeric places - the right-most digits - with zeros. Truncating is not the same as rounding: you'll never get a result with a larger absolute value than the original number. Trunc takes two arguments: the value to truncate and the number of places to truncate it to. Positive values for the second argument indicate the number of digits after the decimal to keep. For example, truncating 42-point-1256 to 2 places keeps only the first two digits after the decimal. Negative values for the second argument indicate places before the decimal to replace with zero. For example, truncating 12,345 to -3 replaces the three digits to the left of the decimal with zero.

# 4. Truncating and grouping

We can use the trunc function to group values in the unanswered_count column into three groups based on the digit in the tens place of the number. Note that the second argument to the trunc function here is a -1. There are 74 values between 30 and 39.

# 5. Generate series

What if you want to group values by a quantity other than the place value of a number, such as by units of 5 or 20? The generate_series function can help. It generates a series of numbers from a starting value to an ending value, inclusive, by steps of a third value.

# 6. Generate series

For example, we can generate a series from 1 to 10 by steps of 2, or a series from 0 to 1 by steps of 1/10th.

# 7. Create bins: output

generate_series can be used to group values into bins. Here's an example of what we want to create: a series of lower and upper values, and the count of the number of observations falling in each bin.

# 8. Create bins: query

Let's build the query to create that output. A WITH clause allows us to alias the results of a subquery to use later in the query. Here, we generate two series: one for the lower bounds of the bins and another for the upper. We name this "bins."

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/443392ed-aa77-40c6-81e0-44d1dfa790c7)

# 9. Create bins: query

Because we're only summarizing data for tag amazon-ebs, we also create that subset of the stackoverflow table and call it ebs.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/981fee6a-2eb9-4fb1-ac49-d0c9e39f9aa6)

# 10. Create bins: query

Then write the main select query to join the results of the subqueries we created and count the values. We join ebs to bins where the column unanswered_count is greater than or equal to the lower bound and strictly less than the upper bound. A left join keeps all bins in the result, even those with no values in them.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/22ee5f45-805b-41ee-91da-e570e66f0b21)

# 11. Create bins: query

Finally, group by the lower and upper bin values to count the values in each bin.

# 12. Create bins: output

Each row in the output has the count of days where the number of unanswered questions was greater than or equal to the lower bound and strictly less than the upper bound. Note that the result contains bins with 0 values. This is because we counted non-null values of unanswered_count instead of just the number of rows.

# 13. Time to explore some distributions!

Alright, have fun exploring distributions!

# Truncate

Use trunc() to examine the distributions of attributes of the Fortune 500 companies.

Remember that trunc() truncates numbers by replacing lower place value digits with zeros:

trunc(value_to_truncate, places_to_truncate)
Negative values for places_to_truncate indicate digits to the left of the decimal to replace, while positive values indicate digits to the right of the decimal to keep.

1. Use trunc() to truncate employees to the 100,000s (5 zeros).
Count the number of observations with each truncated value.

```
-- Truncate employees
SELECT TRUNC(employees, -5) AS employee_bin,
       -- Count number of companies with each truncated value
       COUNT(*)
  FROM fortune500
 -- Use alias to group
 GROUP BY employee_bin
 -- Use alias to order
 ORDER BY employee_bin;
```

2. 
Repeat step 1 for companies with < 100,000 employees (most common).
This time, truncate employees to the 10,000s place.

```
-- Truncate employees
SELECT TRUNC(employees, -4) AS employee_bin,
       -- Count number of companies with each truncated value
       COUNT(*)
  FROM fortune500
 -- Limit to which companies?
 WHERE employees < 100000
 -- Use alias to group
 GROUP BY employee_bin
 -- Use alias to order
 ORDER BY employee_bin;
```

Start exploring a distribution by grouping values into large bins, then refine as needed for ranges of values where there are a lot of observations.

# Generate series

Summarize the distribution of the number of questions with the tag "dropbox" on Stack Overflow per day by binning the data.

Recall:

generate_series(from, to, step)
You can reference the slides using the PDF icon in the upper right corner of the screen.

1. Start by selecting the minimum and maximum of the question_count column for the tag 'dropbox' so you know the range of values to cover with the bins.

```
-- Select the min and max of question_count
SELECT MIN(question_count), 
       MAX(question_count)
  -- From what table?
  FROM stackoverflow
 -- For tag dropbox
 WHERE tag = 'dropbox';
```

2. Next, use generate_series() to create bins of size 50 from 2200 to 3100.

To do this, you need an upper and lower bound to define a bin.

This will require you to modify the stopping value of the lower bound and the starting value of the upper bound by the bin width.

```
-- Create lower and upper bounds of bins
SELECT generate_series(2200, 3050, 50) AS lower,
       generate_series(2250, 3100, 50) AS upper;
```

3. Select lower and upper from bins, along with the count of values within each bin bounds.

To do this, you'll need to join 'dropbox', which contains the question_count for tag "dropbox", to the bins created by generate_series().

The join should occur where the count is greater than or equal to the lower bound, and strictly less than the upper bound.

```
-- Bins created in Step 2
WITH bins AS (
      SELECT generate_series(2200, 3050, 50) AS lower,
             generate_series(2250, 3100, 50) AS upper),
     -- Subset stackoverflow to just tag dropbox (Step 1)
     dropbox AS (
      SELECT question_count 
        FROM stackoverflow
       WHERE tag = 'dropbox') 
-- Select columns for result
-- What column are you counting to summarize?
SELECT lower, upper, count(question_count) 
  FROM bins  -- Created above
       -- Join to dropbox (created above), 
       -- keeping all rows from the bins table in the join
       LEFT JOIN dropbox
       -- Compare question_count to lower and upper
         ON question_count >= lower 
        AND question_count < upper
 -- Group by lower and upper to count values in each bin
 GROUP BY lower, upper
 -- Order by lower to put bins in order
 ORDER BY lower;
```

generate_series allows you to group values into any size interval and also include ranges with zero values.
