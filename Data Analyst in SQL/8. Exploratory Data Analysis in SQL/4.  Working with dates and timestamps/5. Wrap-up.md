# 3. Parting tips

As you continue to explore this data, or start working with your own databases, I'd like to leave you with a few parting tips. First, time spent on exploratory data analysis is never wasted. Understanding your data in depth before moving on to more complicated analyses is essential. Second, use the Postgres documentation. It provides examples of how to use the functions covered in this course and additional ones you may find useful. Third, be curious. Ask questions of your data. See what you can find out. Verify your assumptions with the data. Fourth, don't compute summary measures such as the average or variance without first looking at the distribution of your data. Data is never as clean as you'd like. Always check for errors, and expect to find them. Summary measures are useful, but they aren't a substitute for understanding a variable's distribution.
