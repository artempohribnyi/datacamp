# 1. Splitting and concatenating text

When working with text values, you often need to break strings apart into multiple pieces, extract part of a string to a new variable, or join, or concatenate, strings together. There are functions to help us with these operations.

# 2. Substring

First, how do we extract just part of a string? The left and right functions take as arguments a string, or the name of a column of strings, and the number of characters to keep. Left keeps characters starting at the left, while right keeps characters counting from the end. Here, the first two characters in the string abcde are a and b, while the last two characters are d and e. If the string contains fewer than the requested number of characters, only the available characters are returned.

# 3. Substring

To extract characters from the middle of a string, use the substring function. The function takes a string or column to operate on, and then the keyword FROM. Next comes the index of the character to start with, counting from 1. Then the keyword FOR followed by the number of characters to include in the substring. For example, if we take the substring of abcdef starting from position 2 and going for 3 characters, we get bcd. B was the second character in the string, and the function extracted 3 characters. You may also see an abbreviated version of substring with a shortened function name and comma-separated arguments. It works the same way. The left, right, and substring functions can be useful in situations such as extracting a snippet from a long unstructured text field, displaying just the first or last few digits of an account number, or limiting a zip code to only the first 5 digits.

# 4. Delimiters

The second string operation to know is how to split a string into parts based on a delimiter. A delimiter is a character, such as a comma, or a string that separates fields or chunks of text.

# 5. Splitting on a delimiter

The function split_part takes a string, the delimiter to split the string on, and the number position of the part of the split string to return, counting from one. For example, if we split the string a-comma-bc-comma-d with a comma as the delimiter, the string would be split into 3 parts: a, bc, and d. If we ask for the second part, we get bc. Note that the delimiter is not included in the returned value.

# 6. Splitting on a delimiter

The delimiter can be a single character or a string of multiple characters. For example, if we split the string "cats and dogs and fish" on "and" surrounded by spaces, the first group is cats. Note that the string was split on the delimiter exactly as it appears, not on the set of characters included in the delimiter. It is common to split strings on a delimiter value when multiple pieces of information have been stored together in a single column.

# 7. Concatenating text

The third string operation is concatenation. The concat function takes any number of arguments. It joins the text representation of all of the values together in a single string. You can concatenate both character types and non-character types. Values can also be concatenated with a double pipe, which looks like two vertical bars. This operator is the SQL standard for string concatenation. It works the same as the concat function except when null values are included. The concat function omits null values, while the double pipe will return null if any component is null. One example of when you might concatenate strings is to join a first name and last name stored in separate columns to get a person's full name.

# 8. Manipulate some strings!

Alright, time to practice manipulating strings with the functions you've learned.

# Concatenate strings

House number (house_num) and street are in two separate columns in evanston311. Concatenate them together with concat() with a space in between the values.

Concatenate house_num, a space ' ', and street into a single value using the concat().
Use a trim function to remove any spaces from the start of the concatenated value.

```
-- Concatenate house_num, a space, and street
-- and trim spaces from the start of the result
SELECT TRIM(CONCAT(house_num, ' ', street)) AS address
  FROM evanston311;
```

When joining values that might be NULL with a separator between them, consider using the concat_ws() function, which you can read about in the PostgreSQL documentation, to avoid duplicate or unnecessary separators in the result.

# Split strings on a delimiter

The street suffix is the part of the street name that gives the type of street, such as Avenue, Road, or Street. In the Evanston 311 data, sometimes the street suffix is the full word, while other times it is the abbreviation.

Extract just the first word of each street value to find the most common streets regardless of the suffix.

To do this, use

split_part(string_to_split, delimiter, part_number)

Use split_part() to select the first word in street; alias the result as street_name.
Also select the count of each value of street_name.

```
-- Select the first word of the street value
SELECT SPLIT_PART(street, ' ', 1) AS street_name, 
       count(*)
  FROM evanston311
 GROUP BY street_name
 ORDER BY count DESC
 LIMIT 20;
```

# Shorten long strings

The description column of evanston311 can be very long. You can get the length of a string with the length() function.

For displaying or quickly reviewing the data, you might want to only display the first few characters. You can use the left() function to get a specified number of characters at the start of each value.

To indicate that more data is available, concatenate '...' to the end of any shortened description. To do this, you can use a CASE WHEN statement to add '...' only when the string length is greater than 50.

Select the first 50 characters of description when description starts with the word "I".

Select the first 50 characters of description with '...' concatenated on the end where the length() of the description is greater than 50 characters. Otherwise just select the description as is.

Select only descriptions that begin with the word 'I' and not the letter 'I'.

For example, you would want to select "I like using SQL!", but would not want to select "In this course we use SQL!".

```
-- Select the first 50 chars when length is greater than 50
SELECT CASE WHEN length(description) > 50
            THEN LEFT(description, 50) || '...'
       -- otherwise just select description
       ELSE description
       END
  FROM evanston311
 -- limit to descriptions that start with the word I
 WHERE description LIKE 'I %'
 ORDER BY description;
```

Shortening long fields can help you scan the values quickly and spot patterns you might not otherwise see.
