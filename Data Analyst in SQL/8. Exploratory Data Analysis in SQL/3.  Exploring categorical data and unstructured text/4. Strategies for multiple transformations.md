# 1. Strategies for Multiple Transformations

You've learned several ways to transform character data. But what do you do when you need to use different transformations on different observations?

# 2. Multiple transformations

Here's an example of data where different delimiter characters were used to separate the major industry categories of Agriculture and Education, from the industry subcategories. Sometimes there's a colon, other times there's a pipe character or a dash. We can use the split_part function to separate the category into its two parts, but how can we apply different delimiters to different rows?

# 3. CASE WHEN

One option when you need to apply multiple transformations to subsets of the data that don't overlap is to use a CASE WHEN statement. We want to extract just the initial major category from the category column - the part before a delimiter. To do that, we have a case for each different delimiter: a colon followed by space, a dash surrounded by spaces, and a pipe surrounded by spaces. The last case here goes in the else clause. We use LIKE statements to select the rows with each type of delimiter, then apply the split_part function with the delimiter for those rows. We alias the result of the CASE WHEN statement as major_category. We can then use the major_category we extracted to group and aggregate the data. This allows us to get the number of businesses in each of the two major categories.

# 4. Recoding table

Another strategy for situations when you need to apply multiple transformations is to create a temporary table that maps messy values,like those in this fruit table, to recoded, clean, standardized values, like those on the right. You can then use the new recoded values in the standardized column by joining the fruit table to the temporary table. The values in the original column match those in the fav_fruit column.

# 5. Step 1: CREATE TEMP TABLE

The first step is to create a temporary table with two columns: original, containing the distinct values of fav_fruit and standardized, which will eventually contain the recoded values. We initially populate the standardized column with the original values.

# 6. Initial table

Here's what our recode table looks like initially.

# 7. Step 2: UPDATE values

The next step is to update the recode table using functions to clean up the values in the standardized column. The format of an update statement is UPDATE, then the name of the table, then a SET statement. You SET a column to have new values. Update statements can also include a WHERE clause to choose what rows to update. Without a WHERE clause, all of the rows will be updated.

# 8. Step 2: UPDATE values

Here, we need three update statements. In the first, we set the standardized value to be the lower case version of the original value, with spaces trimmed from both ends. In the second, we set the standardized value to banana only for rows that contained a double n. The third statement updates the standardized value by removing s's from the end with the trim function.

# 9. Resulting recode table

Now the recode table contains clean, standardized values.

# 10. Step 3: JOIN original and recode tables

The final step is to use the recode table by joining it to the original data. On the left, without the recoded data, we have many different values of apple and banana even when we group by fav_fruit. On the right, we join the messy fruit table to the recode table by matching the original values. We select and group by the new standardized values to get a much more useful summary of the data.

# 11. Recap

To recap, we first created a temporary table to store our standardized values, then updated that table to fix errors and clean up the data. Finally, we used joined the original data to the temporary table to use the clean, standardized values in the query instead of the original values.

# 12. Clean up the Evanston 311 data!

Temporary tables and CASE WHEN statements can also be useful in other situations. Time to practice using them to clean up the Evanston 311 data.

# Create an "other" category

If we want to summarize Evanston 311 requests by zip code, it would be useful to group all of the low frequency zip codes together in an "other" category.

Which of the following values, when substituted for ??? in the query, would give the result below?

Query:

SELECT CASE WHEN zipcount < ??? THEN 'other'
       ELSE zip
       END AS zip_recoded,
       sum(zipcount) AS zipsum
  FROM (SELECT zip, count(*) AS zipcount
          FROM evanston311
         GROUP BY zip) AS fullcounts
 GROUP BY zip_recoded
 ORDER BY zipsum DESC;
Result:

zip_recoded    zipsum
60201          19054
60202          11165
null           5528
other          429
60208          255

```
SELECT CASE WHEN zipcount < 255 THEN 'other'
       ELSE zip
       END AS zip_recoded,
       sum(zipcount) AS zipsum
  FROM (SELECT zip, count(*) AS zipcount
          FROM evanston311
         GROUP BY zip) AS fullcounts
 GROUP BY zip_recoded
 ORDER BY zipsum DESC;
```

All of the zip codes with fewer observations than 60208 have less than 100 rows in the table.

# Group and recode values

There are almost 150 distinct values of evanston311.category. But some of these categories are similar, with the form "Main Category - Details". We can get a better sense of what requests are common if we aggregate by the main category.

To do this, create a temporary table recode mapping distinct category values to new, standardized values. Make the standardized values the part of the category before a dash ('-'). Extract this value with the split_part() function:

split_part(string text, delimiter text, field int)
You'll also need to do some additional cleanup of a few cases that don't fit this pattern.

Then the evanston311 table can be joined to recode to group requests by the new standardized category values.

1. Create recode with a standardized column; use split_part() and then rtrim() to remove any remaining whitespace on the result of split_part().

```
-- Fill in the command below with the name of the temp table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recode;

-- Create and name the temporary table
CREATE TEMP TABLE recode AS
-- Write the select query to generate the table 
-- with distinct values of category and standardized values
  SELECT DISTINCT category, 
         RTRIM(SPLIT_PART(category, '-', 1)) AS standardized
    -- What table are you selecting the above values from?
    FROM evanston311;
    
-- Look at a few values before the next step
SELECT DISTINCT standardized 
  FROM recode
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Trash%Cart'
    OR standardized LIKE 'Snow%Removal%';
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/2553b59d-de30-4cbd-bd1a-d5fe6d7050db)

2. UPDATE standardized values LIKE 'Trash%Cart' to 'Trash Cart'.
UPDATE standardized values of 'Snow Removal/Concerns' and 'Snow/Ice/Hazard Removal' to 'Snow Removal'.

```
-- Code from previous step
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recode;

CREATE TEMP TABLE recode AS
  SELECT DISTINCT category, 
         rtrim(split_part(category, '-', 1)) AS standardized
    FROM evanston311;

-- Update to group trash cart values
UPDATE recode 
   SET standardized ='Trash Cart' 
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Trash%Cart';

-- Update to group snow removal values
UPDATE recode  
   SET standardized ='Snow Removal' 
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Snow%Removal%';
    
-- Examine effect of updates
SELECT DISTINCT standardized 
  FROM recode
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Trash%Cart'
    OR standardized LIKE 'Snow%Removal%';
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/b89ccc1b-c651-4580-88c4-3f188a261faa)

3. UPDATE recode by setting standardized values of 'THIS REQUEST IS INACTIVEâ€¦Trash Cart', '(DO NOT USE) Water Bill', 'DO NOT USE Trash', and 'NO LONGER IN USE' to 'UNUSED'.

```
-- Code from previous step
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recode;

CREATE TEMP TABLE recode AS
  SELECT DISTINCT category, 
         rtrim(split_part(category, '-', 1)) AS standardized
    FROM evanston311;
  
UPDATE recode SET standardized='Trash Cart' 
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Trash%Cart';

UPDATE recode SET standardized='Snow Removal' 
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Snow%Removal%';

-- Update to group unused/inactive values
UPDATE recode 
   SET standardized = 'UNUSED' 
 WHERE standardized IN ('THIS REQUEST IS INACTIVE...Trash Cart', 
               '(DO NOT USE) Water Bill',
               'DO NOT USE Trash',
               'NO LONGER IN USE');

-- Examine effect of updates
SELECT DISTINCT standardized 
  FROM recode
 ORDER BY standardized; 
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/b4b6f6a2-0e00-4f68-968a-49868e99fbb9)

4. Now, join the evanston311 and recode tables to count the number of requests with each of the standardized values
List the most common standardized values first.

```
-- Code from previous step
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recode;
CREATE TEMP TABLE recode AS
  SELECT DISTINCT category, 
         rtrim(split_part(category, '-', 1)) AS standardized
  FROM evanston311;
UPDATE recode SET standardized='Trash Cart' 
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Trash%Cart';
UPDATE recode SET standardized='Snow Removal' 
 WHERE standardized LIKE 'Snow%Removal%';
UPDATE recode SET standardized='UNUSED' 
 WHERE standardized IN ('THIS REQUEST IS INACTIVE...Trash Cart', 
               '(DO NOT USE) Water Bill',
               'DO NOT USE Trash', 'NO LONGER IN USE');

-- Select the recoded categories and the count of each
SELECT standardized, COUNT(*)
-- From the original table and table with recoded values
  FROM recode 
       INNER JOIN evanston311 
       -- What column do they have in common?
       ON recode.category = evanston311.category 
 -- What do you need to group by to count?
 GROUP BY standardized
 -- Display the most common val values first
 ORDER BY count DESC;
```

You now have a strategy for recoding the values of a variable. Next, you'll use a similar approach to create some new variables.

# Create a table with indicator variables

Determine whether medium and high priority requests in the evanston311 data are more likely to contain requesters' contact information: an email address or phone number.

Emails contain an @.
Phone numbers have the pattern of three characters, dash, three characters, dash, four characters. For example: 555-555-1212.
Use LIKE to match these patterns. Remember % matches any number of characters (even 0), and _ matches a single character. Enclosing a pattern in % (i.e. before and after your pattern) allows you to locate it within other text.

For example, '%___.com%'would allow you to search for a reference to a website with the top-level domain '.com' and at least three characters preceding it.

Create and store indicator variables for email and phone in a temporary table. LIKE produces True or False as a result, but casting a boolean (True or False) as an integer converts True to 1 and False to 0. This makes the values easier to summarize later.

1. Create a temp table indicators from evanston311 with three columns: id, email, and phone.

Use LIKE comparisons to detect the email and phone patterns that are in the description, and cast the result as an integer with CAST().

Your phone indicator should use a combination of underscores _ and dashes - to represent a standard 10-digit phone number format.
Remember to start and end your patterns with % so that you can locate the pattern within other text!

```
-- To clear table if it already exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS indicators;

-- Create the indicators temp table
CREATE TEMP TABLE indicators AS
  -- Select id
  SELECT id, 
         -- Create the email indicator (find @)
         CAST (description LIKE '%@%' AS integer) AS email,
         -- Create the phone indicator
         CAST (description LIKE '%___-___-____%' AS integer) AS phone 
    -- What table contains the data? 
    FROM evanston311;

-- Inspect the contents of the new temp table
SELECT *
  FROM indicators;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/6c5ae56f-ac03-4a04-841b-4666b55eed7d)

2. Join the indicators table to evanston311, selecting the proportion of reports including an email or phone grouped by priority.
Include adjustments to account for issues arising from integer division.

```
-- To clear table if it already exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS indicators;

-- Create the temp table
CREATE TEMP TABLE indicators AS
  SELECT id, 
         CAST (description LIKE '%@%' AS integer) AS email,
         CAST (description LIKE '%___-___-____%' AS integer) AS phone 
    FROM evanston311;
  
-- Select the column you'll group by
SELECT priority,
       -- Compute the proportion of rows with each indicator
       SUM(email)/COUNT(*)::numeric AS email_prop, 
       SUM(phone)/COUNT(*)::numeric AS phone_prop
  -- Tables to select from
  FROM evanston311
       LEFT JOIN indicators
       -- Joining condition
       ON evanston311.id = indicators.id
 -- What are you grouping by?
 GROUP BY priority;
```

You not only created new variables but also used them successfully to learn about the data. Medium and high priority requests do contain contact information more frequently.
