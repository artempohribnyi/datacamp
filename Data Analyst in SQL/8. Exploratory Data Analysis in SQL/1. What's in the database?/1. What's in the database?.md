Start exploring a database by identifying the tables and the foreign keys that link them. Look for missing values, count the number of observations, and join tables to understand how they're related. Learn about coalescing and casting data along the way.

# 1. What's in the database?

Hi, my name is Christina Maimone. I'm a data scientist at Northwestern University, where I help researchers with their data challenges. In this course, you'll learn how to explore a SQL database, summarize different types of data, and deal with messy data. You've already learned a number of skills in the previous SQL courses that will help you with these tasks. In this chapter, we'll review some of those skills, pick up some new ones, and see how they apply to exploratory data analysis.

# 2. PostgreSQL

One note before we start. This course uses PostgreSQL. Many of the functions we'll use are also available in other SQL database systems, but their names or syntax may be different. If you're using another database system, you should refer to the system's documentation to learn the correct syntax. With that,

# 3. Database client

let's get started. You've finally been granted access to your company's database. Yay! But where do you begin? What are the tables? How are they related? What columns exist in the tables? A database client is a program used to connect to, and work with, a database. There are many different database clients. Each one has a different way to retrieve information on the table names, the columns in each table, and the formal relationships between the tables. Refer to your client program's documentation to find the commands to extract this information.

# 4. Entity relationship diagram

You may also be given information about the structure of the database from the database owner or creator. One type of documentation is an entity-relationship diagram that shows the tables, their columns, and the relationships between the tables. Here is the entity-relationship diagram for the database for this course. There are six tables.

# 5. ER diagram: evanston311

The evanston311 table contains help requests sent to the city of Evanston, Illinois.

# 6. ER diagram: fortune500

fortune500 contains information on the 500 largest US companies by revenue from 2017.

# 7. ER diagram: stackoverflow

stackoverflow contains data from the popular programming question and answer site. It includes daily counts of the number of questions that were tagged as being related to select technology companies.

# 8. ER diagram: supporting

company, tag_company, and tag_type are supporting tables with additional information related to the stackoverflow data.

# 9. Select a few rows

Once you know the names of the tables in the database, one way to get a sense of what's in a table is to simply select a few rows from it. Here we use the star to select all columns from the company table and use limit to return only 5 rows. Remember that the rows returned from a table are in no particular order by default.

# 10. A few reminders

As you start to explore the contents of a table, keep a few additional things in mind. NULL indicates missing data in a database.

# 11. A few reminders

To check which values are NULL, use "is NULL" or "is not NULL", not an equals sign.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/1efb072b-fdc6-4361-bd33-50d203768aa5)

# 12. A few reminders

The count function with a star counts the number of rows.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/547dd64e-04b2-4204-86de-63e32691f533)

# 13. A few reminders

If you instead supply a column name to the count function, it counts the number of non-NULL observations in the column. This is equal to the total number of rows, minus the number of NULL values.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/23d03584-72c8-45ff-a6f2-da6954bb1df8)

# 14. A few reminders

If you count the distinct values of a column, you'll get the number of different non-NULL values in the column.

# 15. A few reminders

But if you select those distinct values directly, NULL will be included as a value if it exists in the column, even though it isn't counted by the count function.

# 16. Let's start exploring

With those tips in mind, it's time to start exploring the course database through exercises.

# Explore table sizes

Let's start by exploring five related tables:

stackoverflow: questions asked on Stack Overflow with certain tags
company: information on companies related to tags in stackoverflow
tag_company: links stackoverflow to company
tag_type: type categories applied to tags in stackoverflow
fortune500: information on top US companies
Count the number of rows in a table with

SELECT count(*) 
  FROM tablename;
Count the number of columns in a table by selecting a few rows and manually counting the columns in the result.

Which table has the most rows? Which table has the most columns?

```
WITH all_tables AS 
(SELECT 
    (SELECT table_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'stackoverflow'
    GROUP BY table_name) AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS num_of_rows,
    (SELECT count(*)
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'stackoverflow') AS num_of_columns
FROM
    stackoverflow
UNION
SELECT
    (SELECT table_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'company'
    GROUP BY table_name) AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS num_of_rows,
    (SELECT count(*)
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'company') AS num_of_columns
FROM company
UNION
SELECT
    (SELECT table_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'tag_company'
    GROUP BY table_name) AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS num_of_rows,
    (SELECT count(*)
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'tag_company') AS num_of_columns
FROM tag_company
UNION
SELECT
    (SELECT table_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'tag_type'
    GROUP BY table_name) AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS num_of_rows,
    (SELECT count(*)
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'tag_type') AS num_of_columns
FROM tag_type
UNION
SELECT
    (SELECT table_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'fortune500'
    GROUP BY table_name) AS table_name,
    COUNT(*) AS num_of_rows,
    (SELECT count(*)
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'fortune500') AS num_of_columns
FROM fortune500)

SELECT *
FROM all_tables
ORDER BY num_of_rows DESC,	num_of_columns DESC;
```

# Count missing values

Which column of fortune500 has the most missing values? To find out, you'll need to check each column individually, although here we'll check just three.

Course Note: While you're unlikely to encounter this issue during this exercise, note that if you run a query that takes more than a few seconds to execute, your session may expire or you may be disconnected from the server. You will not have this issue with any of the exercise solutions, so if your session expires or disconnects, there's an error with your query.

```
-- Select the count of industry, 
-- subtract from total number of rows, and alias as missing
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(industry) AS missing
FROM 
    fortune500
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/8048febc-2a8a-46bf-960a-e65ea69f4492)

Note that the result of a call to count(*) is labelled count in the result. You can refer to this column with count in ORDER BY clauses without explicitly aliasing count(*) AS count.

# Join tables

Part of exploring a database is figuring out how tables relate to each other. The company and fortune500 tables don't have a formal relationship between them in the database, but this doesn't prevent you from joining them.

To join the tables, you need to find a column that they have in common where the values are consistent across the tables. Remember: just because two tables have a column with the same name, it doesn't mean those columns necessarily contain compatible data. If you find more than one pair of columns with similar data, you may need to try joining with each in turn to see if you get the same number of results.

Reference the entity relationship diagram if needed.

```
SELECT company.name
-- Table(s) to select from
  FROM company
       INNER JOIN fortune500
       ON company.ticker = fortune500.ticker;
```

You can join tables when they share a column with consistent data values.
