# 1. The keys to the database

The second stage of exploring a database is understanding the formal relationships, or links, between tables. These explicit relationships are one of the benefits of having your data in a database rather than in a set of individual data files.

# 2. Foreign keys

Foreign keys are the formal way that database tables are linked together. In this example, the actor_id column in the film_actor table is a foreign key that references the id column of the actor table.

# 3. Foreign keys

A foreign key is a column that references a single, specific row in the database. The referenced row is usually in a different table, but foreign keys can reference rows in the same table as well. Foreign keys reference other rows using a unique identifier for the row. The unique ID often comes from a primary key column in the referenced table. Primary keys are specially designated columns where each row has a unique, non-null value. Foreign key columns are restricted to contain either a value that is in the referenced column, or null. If the value is null, it indicates that there's no relationship for that row.

# 4. ER diagram

Let's look at the entity relationship diagram for our database. In the diagram, foreign keys are indicated on the arrows between tables.

# 5. ER diagram

The value before the colon is the name of the column in the table from which the arrow originates. The value after the colon is the name of the referenced column in the table the arrow is pointing to. So the company_id column in the tag_company table refers to the id column in the company table.

# 6. ER diagram

When an arrow points from and to the same table, this is a self reference. parent_id in the company table references the id column in the same table.

# 7. ER diagram

Note that there's no foreign key linking the company table to the fortune500 table. But this doesn't prevent us from joining these tables. Both tables have ticker columns with comparable values that can be used to join the tables. The lack of a foreign key relationship just means that the values in the ticker columns aren't restricted to the set of values in the other table.

# 8. Primary Keys

The diagram also shows which columns are primary keys. Primary keys have a border around them at the top of each list of columns. Primary keys uniquely identify the rows in the table.

# 9. Coalesce function

Before you return to the exercises, let's add the coalesce function to your toolkit. coalesce takes two or more values or column names as arguments. The three dots in square brackets here indicate that additional values can be supplied as inputs. The coalesce function operates row-wise on the input. It returns the first non-NULL value in each row, checking the columns in the order they're supplied to the function.

# 10. Coalesce function

Here's an example. We have a table called prices with two columns. Remember that blanks are null values. We can use coalesce to combine these two columns. If column_1 is not null, coalesce returns that value. If column_1 is null, coalesce returns the value of column_2. In this example, the first value returned by coalesce is 10. This is because, in the first row of prices, the value of column_1 is NULL. So coalesce returns the value of column_2. Coalesce returned four values because there were four rows in the input. Coalesce is useful for specifying default or backup values when selecting a column that might contain NULL values.

# 11. Time to keep exploring!

OK, time to use your knowledge of foreign keys and the coalesce function to continue exploring the database.

# Foreign keys

Recall that foreign keys reference another row in the database via a unique ID. Values in a foreign key column are restricted to values in the referenced column OR NULL.

Using what you know about foreign keys, why can't the tag column in the tag_type table be a foreign key that references the tag column in the stackoverflow table?

Remember, you can reference the slides using the icon in the upper right of the screen to review the requirements for a foreign key.

```
SELECT
    DISTINCT tag
FROM
 tag_type;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/02e0c87f-72d7-42bf-a6e4-2c623501c854)

Foreign keys must reference a column with unique values for each row so the referenced row can be identified.

# Read an entity relationship diagram

The information you need is sometimes split across multiple tables in the database.

What is the most common stackoverflow tag_type? What companies have a tag of that type?

To generate a list of such companies, you'll need to join three tables together.

Reference the entity relationship diagram as needed when determining which columns to use when joining tables.

* First, using the tag_type table, count the number of tags with each type.
* Order the results to find the most common tag type.
```
-- Count the number of tags with each type
SELECT type, COUNT(tag) AS count
  FROM tag_type
 -- To get the count for each type, what do you need to do?
GROUP BY type
 -- Order the results with the most common
 -- tag types listed first
 ORDER BY count DESC;
```

Join the tag_company, company, and tag_type tables, keeping only mutually occurring records.
Select company.name, tag_type.tag, and tag_type.type for tags with the most common type from the previous step.

```
-- Select the 3 columns desired
SELECT company.name, tag_type.tag, tag_type.type
  FROM company
  	   -- Join to the tag_company table
       INNER JOIN tag_company 
       ON company.id = tag_company.company_id
       -- Join to the tag_type table
       INNER JOIN tag_type
       ON tag_company.tag = tag_type.tag
  -- Filter to most common type
  WHERE type ='cloud';
```

You could combine these steps in a single query by using a subquery in the WHERE clause instead of the value 'cloud'.

# Coalesce

The coalesce() function can be useful for specifying a default or backup value when a column contains NULL values.

coalesce() checks arguments in order and returns the first non-NULL value, if one exists.

coalesce(NULL, 1, 2) = 1
coalesce(NULL, NULL) = NULL
coalesce(2, 3, NULL) = 2
In the fortune500 data, industry contains some missing values. Use coalesce() to use the value of sector as the industry when industry is NULL. Then find the most common industry.

* Use coalesce() to select the first non-NULL value from industry, sector, or 'Unknown' as a fallback value.
* Alias the result of the call to coalesce() as industry2.
* Count the number of rows with each industry2 value.
* Find the most common value of industry2.

```
-- Use coalesce
SELECT COALESCE(industry, sector, 'Unknown') AS industry2,
       -- Don't forget to count!
       COUNT(*) 
  FROM fortune500 
-- Group by what? (What are you counting by?)
 GROUP BY industry2
-- Order results to see most common first
 ORDER BY count DESC
-- Limit results to get just the one value you want
 LIMIT 1;
```

'coalesce' is essential when the value you need could be in more than one column. In the next exercise, you'll use coalesce as part of a self join.

# Coalesce with a self-join

You previously joined the company and fortune500 tables to find out which companies are in both tables. Now, also include companies from company that are subsidiaries of Fortune 500 companies as well.

To include subsidiaries, you will need to join company to itself to associate a subsidiary with its parent company's information. To do this self-join, use two different aliases for company.

'coalesce' will help you combine the two ticker columns in the result of the self-join to join to fortune500.

* Join company to itself to add information about a company's parent to the original company's information.
* Use coalesce to get the parent company ticker if available and the original company ticker otherwise.
* INNER JOIN to fortune500 using the ticker.
* Select original company name, fortune500 title and rank.
```
SELECT company_original.name, title, rank
  -- Start with original company information
  FROM company AS company_original
       -- Join to another copy of company with parent
       -- company information
	   LEFT JOIN company AS company_parent
       ON company_original.parent_id = company_parent.id 
       -- Join to fortune500, only keep rows that match
       INNER JOIN fortune500 
       -- Use parent ticker if there is one, 
       -- otherwise original ticker
       ON coalesce(company_parent.ticker, 
                   company_original.ticker) = 
             fortune500.ticker
 -- For clarity, order by rank
 ORDER BY rank; 
```
Self-joins can get confusing. Use meaningful aliases to help keep everything straight.
