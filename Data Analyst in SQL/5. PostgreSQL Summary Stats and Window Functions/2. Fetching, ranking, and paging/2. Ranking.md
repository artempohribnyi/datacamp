# 1. Ranking

Another common application of window functions is ranking rows according to their values. Let's learn about the three ranking functions in this video.

# 2. The ranking functions

You've already encountered one ranking function last chapter: ROW_NUMBER. Assigning numbers to rows is one way of ranking them. ROW_NUMBER always assigns unique numbers, even if two rows' values are the same; it chooses some other metric to assign numbers if the value by which it's ordering is the same. Another ranking function is RANK. It assigns the same number to rows with identical values, skipping over the next numbers in such cases. Finally, DENSE_RANK also assigns the same number to rows with identical values, but doesn't skip over the next numbers. This sounds a bit abstract, so let's see all three functions used at once to distinguish between their outputs.

# 3. Source table

This query returns the number of Olympic games in which each of these countries has participated. Notice that some countries, such as France and Denmark, have participated in the same number of games. How would you rank them? Let's apply the three ranking functions to see how each handles these repeated values.

# 4. Different ranking functions - ROW_NUMBER

After wrapping the previous query in a CTE and applying the three ranking functions to them, let's see the differences in the output. ROW_NUMBER's output is familiar; it assigns a unique number to each row based on the provided order. If two rows have the same value, it still assigns them unique numbers, but based on an internally selected order.

# 5. Different ranking functions - RANK

RANK will assign the same number to two rows if their values are equal; both Denmark and France are second here. After the repeated ranks, it skips over the next rank, and immediately goes to four for Italy. RANK always skips over the next numbers if it assigns the same number to two or more rows.

# 6. Different ranking functions - DENSE_RANK

DENSE_RANK also assigns 2 to Denmark and France, but instead of skipping the next rank, it assigns 3 to Italy. DENSE_RANK never skips ranks. ROW_NUMBER and RANK will have the same last rank, the count of rows, while DENSE_RANK's last rank is the count of unique values being ranked.

# 7. Ranking without partitioning - Source table

What if you have several groups you need to rank separately in your data? This query returns two groups of athletes from China and Russia that need to be ranked by how many medals they've earned. Let's see what happens when you rank them without partitioning.

# 8. Ranking without partitioning

The two groups of athletes are ranked here without partitioning. Because of the ORDER BY clause at the end of the query, the results are ordered correctly, but notice that the Russian athletes who won 2 medals each are ranked third, when they should be ranked second. That's because they're ranked relative to the entire table, not to the Russian group of athletes.

# 9. Ranking with partitioning

After partitioning by country, the Russian athletes are correctly assigned the second rank because they're being ranked only relative to the other athletes in their group or partition. If you have more than one group whose rows you want to rank, make sure to partition by the column that splits your rows into the correct groups.

# 10. Let's practice!

Practice ranking rows with the different ranking functions in the following exercises.

# Ranking athletes by medals earned

In chapter 1, you used ROW_NUMBER to rank athletes by awarded medals. However, ROW_NUMBER assigns different numbers to athletes with the same count of awarded medals, so it's not a useful ranking function; if two athletes earned the same number of medals, they should have the same rank.

Rank each athlete by the number of medals they've earned -- the higher the count, the higher the rank -- with identical numbers in case of identical values.

```
WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  Athlete,
  Medals,
  -- Rank athletes by the medals they've won
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY medals DESC) AS Rank_N
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Medals DESC;
```

RANK's output corresponds to the actual Olympics' ranking system.

# Ranking athletes from multiple countries

In the previous exercise, you used RANK to assign rankings to one group of athletes. In real-world data, however, you'll often find numerous groups within your data. Without partitioning your data, one group's values will influence the rankings of the others.

Also, while RANK skips numbers in case of identical values, the most natural way to assign rankings is not to skip numbers. If two countries are tied for second place, the country after them is considered to be third by most people.

Rank each country's athletes by the count of medals they've earned -- the higher the count, the higher the rank -- without skipping numbers in case of identical values.

```
WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Country, Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('JPN', 'KOR')
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Country, Athlete
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)

SELECT
  Country,
  -- Rank athletes in each country by the medals they've won
  athlete,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY country
                ORDER BY Medals DESC) AS Rank_N
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, RANK_N ASC;
```

DENSE_RANK's way of ranking is how we'd typically assign ranks in real life.

# DENSE_RANK's output

You have the following table:

| Country | Medals |
|---------|--------|
| IRN     | 23     |
| IRQ     | 19     |
| LBN     | 19     |
| SYR     | 19     |
| BHR     | 7      |
| KSA     | 3      |

If you were to use DENSE_RANK to order the Medals column in descending order, what rank would BHR be assigned?

DENSE_RANK would rank BHR as 3rd.
