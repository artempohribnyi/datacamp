In this chapter, you'll learn how to use aggregate functions you're familiar with, like `AVG()` and `SUM()`, as window functions, as well as how to define frames to change a window function's output.

# 1. Aggregate window functions

Welcome back! In Chapter 2, you learned about new window functions to fetch, rank, and page rows; in Chapter 3, you'll use aggregate functions you already know in a new context.

# 2. Source table

Let's set up the source table first. This query returns the count of gold medals Brazil earned in these five sets of Olympic games.

# 3. Aggregate functions

After wrapping the previous query in a CTE (represented by the three points), using the MAX and SUM aggregate functions on the Medals column returns the highest medals earned in a year (18) and the total sum of medals earned across those years (64), respectively. These are standard aggregate functions that you can use either over the entire table or with GROUP BY. What if you want to see the maximum medals earned so far, or calculate the cumulative sum of medals earned?

# 4. MAX Window function

You can use both MAX and SUM, as well as the other aggregate functions COUNT, MIN, and AVG, as window functions. In this case, using MAX on the Medals column and defining a window ordered by year in ascending order will show the max medals earned so far for each row. For example, in 1992, Brazil earned 13 medals. Since it's the first row, that's the max so far of medals earned. In the next set of games, those of 1996, only 5 medals were earned, so the max is still 13. In 2004, the games after the 1996 games, 18 medals were earned, which is higher than the previous max of 13, so the max becomes 18. In the next two subsequent games, 14 medals were earned, which is less than 18, so the max remains 18 to the end of the query.

# 5. SUM Window function

SUM can also be used as a window function. With the same window that was defined for MAX used for SUM, SUM calculates the cumulative sum, or running total, of the medals earned so far. The first cumulative sum is 13, because there's no previous value to sum up. The second is 18, the sum of the medals earned in 1992 - 13 - and 1996 - 5.

# 6. Partitioning with aggregate window functions

Just like any other window function, you can partition with aggregate functions. The source table is expanded to include a country column and Cuba's earned medals. In the left table, SUM is used without partitioning by country, so the cumulative sum does not reset per country. The value in the last row, 84, reflects the total medals earned for both Brazil and Cuba. In the right table, SUM is used with partitioning by country, so the cumulative sum resets once the country changes. The last row's value, 46, reflects only the total medals earned by Cuba, while the last row for Brazil represents its own total medals earned, 46.

# 7. Let's practice!

Now that you know how to use aggregate functions in a new context, practice using them in the following exercises.

# Running totals of athlete medals

The running total (or cumulative sum) of a column helps you determine what each row's contribution is to the total sum.

Return the athletes, the number of medals they earned, and the medals running total, ordered by the athletes' names in alphabetical order.

```
WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'USA' AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  -- Calculate the running total of athlete medals
  athlete,
  medals,
  SUM(medals) OVER (ORDER BY athlete ASC) AS Max_Medals
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Athlete ASC;
```

You've used your first aggregate window function.

# Maximum country medals by year

Getting the maximum of a country's earned medals so far helps you determine whether a country has broken its medals record by comparing the current year's earned medals and the maximum so far.

Return the year, country, medals, and the maximum medals earned so far for each country, ordered by year in ascending order.

```
WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, Country, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('CHN', 'KOR', 'JPN')
    AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Year, Country)

SELECT
  -- Return the max medals earned so far per country
  year, 
  country, 
  medals,
  MAX(medals) OVER (PARTITION BY country
                ORDER BY year ASC) AS Max_Medals
FROM Country_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;
```

As with other window functions, you can use partioning with aggregate window functions.

# Minimum country medals by year

So far, you've seen MAX and SUM, aggregate functions normally used with GROUP BY, being used as window functions. You can also use the other aggregate functions, like MIN, as window functions.

Return the year, medals earned, and minimum medals earned so far.

```
WITH France_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'FRA'
    AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  year, medals,
  MIN(medals) OVER (ORDER BY year ASC) AS Min_Medals
FROM France_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;
```

All aggregate functions can be used as window functions.
