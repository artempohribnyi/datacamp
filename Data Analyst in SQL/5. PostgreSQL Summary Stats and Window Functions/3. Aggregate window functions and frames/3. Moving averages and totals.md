# 1. Moving averages and totals

One of the most common uses for aggregate window functions with frames is the calculation of moving averages and totals. Let's see how that's done.

# 2. Overview

A moving average is the average of the last n periods of a column's values. Moving averages are used in a variety of industries. For example, in sales, the 10-day moving average is the average of the last ten days' units sold per day. It's used to indicate momentum and trends; if a day's units sold is higher than its moving average, then the next day, more units are likely to be sold. Moving averages are also useful in eliminating seasonality, the normal fluctuation of units sold per day. A moving total, on the other hand, is the sum of the last n periods of a column's values. For example, the sum of the last 3 Olympic games' medals for any given set of Olympic games. It's used to indicate performance in the recent periods; if the sum is going down, overall performance is going down, and vice-versa.

# 3. Source table

Let's see moving averages and totals in action. The source table is the count of gold medals awarded to the US after 1980.

# 4. Moving average

Let's get the 3-year moving average, which is the average of medals earned in the last two and the current sets of Olympic games for each year. Defining the window as starting two rows before the current row and ending at the current row will pass as input these three rows to the AVG function. The first moving average is equivalent to the first year's awarded medals, since there's no other value to average. The second row's moving average is the average of its value and the first row's value; the third row's moving average is the average of its value and the previous two rows, and so on.

# 5. Moving total

A moving total works in much the same way that the moving average does, but instead of the AVG function, you use the SUM function with the same frame. Thus, the first row's moving total is the first row's value, the second row's moving total is the sum of the first and second rows, and then each subsequent rows' moving total is the sum of its value and the values of the previous two rows.

# 6. ROWS vs RANGE

Recall from the previous video that LAST_VALUE's frame subclause starts with RANGE BETWEEN, whereas the frames you've seen so far start with ROWS BETWEEN. What's the difference? RANGE BETWEEN functions much the same as ROWS BETWEEN, with one major difference. RANGE treats duplicates in the columns in the ORDER BY subclause as single entities, whereas ROWS does not. Assume that you have this table of medals earned per year. Both Rows_RT and Range_RT columns are running totals, but the former uses ROWS to define its frame and the other uses Range. The Rows_RT column has the values you'd expect, but the Range_RT column treats the rows with duplicate values as single rows, summing them up first then displaying that sum for each duplicate row. They both arrive at the same cumulative sum, but how they get there is different. In practice, ROWS BETWEEN is almost always used over RANGE BETWEEN.

# 7. Let's practice!

Let's practice writing queries to calculate moving averages and totals in the following exercises.

# Moving average's frame

If you want your moving average to cover the last 3 and current Olympic games, how would you define its frame?

This covers the current Olympic games, as well as the three preceding sets of games.

# Moving average of Russian medals

Using frames with aggregate window functions allow you to calculate many common metrics, including moving averages and totals. These metrics track the change in performance over time.

Calculate the 3-year moving average of medals earned.

```
WITH Russian_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'RUS'
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 1980
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  Year, Medals,
  --- Calculate the 3-year moving average of medals earned
  AVG(medals) OVER
    (ORDER BY Year ASC
     ROWS BETWEEN
     2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS Medals_MA
FROM Russian_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;
```

You've used all three clauses used to define a frame's start and end and calculate a moving average.

# Moving total of countries' medals

What if your data is split into multiple groups spread over one or more columns in the table? Even with a defined frame, if you can't somehow separate the groups' data, one group's values will affect the average of another group's values.

Calculate the 3-year moving sum of medals earned per country.

You can also use partitioning with frames.
