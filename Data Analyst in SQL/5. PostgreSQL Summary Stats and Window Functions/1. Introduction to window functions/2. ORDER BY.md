# 1. ORDER BY

In the previous video, you learned the basics of a window function. In this video, you'll learn about ORDER BY, one of the subclauses within the OVER clause.

# 2. Row numbers

Recall the row numbering query from the last video. The first row's number is 1, the second is 2, and so on. What if you want to reverse the numbers? In other words, you want to assign 1 to the last row, 2 to the row before last, and so on.

# 3. Enter ORDER BY

Enter ORDER BY. ORDER BY is a subclause of OVER. It orders the rows related to the current row that the window function will use. Taking the row numbering query, if you order by year in descending order within the OVER clause, the function will assign 1 to the first row in that window. That row will have the most recent year in the dataset.

# 4. Ordering by Year in descending order

This is the result. Adding ORDER BY within OVER changed the basis on which the function assigned numbers to rows, assigning lower numbers to the more recent rows.

# 5. Ordering by multiple columns

In the previous results, notice that the results and numbers are only based on a sort by year. What if you want to sort by year and by event? You can order by multiple columns in the OVER clause, just like you normally can outside of it. That'll also change the numbers assigned to each row, since their positions have changed.

# 6. Ordering in- and outside OVER

You can ORDER both inside and outside OVER at the same time. In this query, row numbers are assigned based on the year and the event, but the ordering outside OVER orders by country and row. How will these two orders be executed? First, ROW_NUMBER will assign numbers based on the order within OVER. So the row numbers are given after sorting the table by year and event. After that, the ORDER outside of OVER takes over, and sorts the results of the table by Country and row number. Notice that the first row in the result isn't the row with number 1, because the two orders are based on different columns. From that, you can conclude that the ORDER inside OVER takes effect before the ORDER outside of it.

# 7. Reigning champion

One of the applications of window functions is determining reigning champion status. A reigning champion is a champion who's won both the previous and current years' competitions. To determine if a champion is a reigning champion, the previous and the current years' champions need to be in the same row, in two different columns, so that they can be compared. How can you get a previous row's value without complex self-joins? Enter LAG. LAG is a window function that takes a column and a number n and returns the column's value n rows before the current row. Passing 1 as n returns the previous row's value.

# 8. Current champions

This query returns the Discus Throw champions. Getting each year's champion is the first step to using LAG to get each year's previous champion.

# 9. Current and last champions

After wrapping the previous query in a CTE, which is a way to temporarily store a query's results as a table, select the year and champion, and use LAG on the Champion column with an n of 1, ordering by year in ascending order in OVER. In the results, notice that Last_Champion contains Champion's value from the previous row. The first row has no previous row, so its value is null.

# 10. Let's practice!

Now that you know the ins and outs of the ORDER BY subclause, let's practice using it in the following exercises.

# Numbering Olympic games in descending order

You've already numbered the rows in the Summer Medals dataset. What if you need to reverse the row numbers so that the most recent Olympic games' rows have a lower number?

Assign a number to each year in which Summer Olympic games were held so that rows with the most recent years have lower row numbers.

```
SELECT
  year,
  -- Assign the lowest numbers to the most recent years
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY year DESC) AS Row_N
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT Year
  FROM summer_medals
) AS years
ORDER BY year;
```

You've written your first ORDER BY subclause and changed the behavior of the ROW_NUMBER() window function.

# Numbering Olympic athletes by medals earned

Row numbering can also be used for ranking. For example, numbering rows and ordering by the count of medals each athlete earned in the OVER clause will assign 1 to the highest-earning medalist, 2 to the second highest-earning medalist, and so on.

1. For each athlete, count the number of medals he or she has earned.

```
SELECT
  -- Count the number of medals each athlete has earned
  DISTINCT athlete,
  COUNT(medal) AS Medals
FROM Summer_Medals
GROUP BY Athlete
ORDER BY Medals DESC;
```

2. Having wrapped the previous query in the Athlete_Medals CTE, rank each athlete by the number of medals they've earned.

```
WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    -- Count the number of medals each athlete has earned
    Athlete,
    COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  -- Number each athlete by how many medals they've earned
  athlete,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY medals DESC) AS Row_N
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Medals DESC;
```

In chapter 2, you'll learn more about ranking functions.

# Reigning weightlifting champions

A reigning champion is a champion who's won both the previous and current years' competitions. To determine if a champion is reigning, the previous and current years' results need to be in the same row, in two different columns.

1. Return each year's gold medalists in the Men's 69KG weightlifting competition.

```
SELECT
  -- Return each year's champions' countries
  year,
  country AS champion
FROM Summer_Medals
WHERE
  Discipline = 'Weightlifting' AND
  Event = '69KG' AND
  Gender = 'Men' AND
  Medal = 'Gold';
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/7bbea71b-e057-4bed-a96a-91b4d2077635)

2. Having wrapped the previous query in the Weightlifting_Gold CTE, get the previous year's champion for each year.

```
    -- Return each year's champions' countries
    Year,
    Country AS champion
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Discipline = 'Weightlifting' AND
    Event = '69KG' AND
    Gender = 'Men' AND
    Medal = 'Gold')

SELECT
  Year, Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion
  LAG(Champion, 1) OVER
    (ORDER BY year ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Weightlifting_Gold
ORDER BY Year ASC;
```

You can now compare the two champion columns to see if a champion is reigning.
