# 1. Introduction

Welcome to the course! My name is Michel Semaan. I created this course together with Fernando Gonzalez Prada, owner of FGP Database and Analytics. I'll be your instructor for this course.

# 2. Motivation

Before diving into the course, let's explore why you'd want to learn window functions. The left table contains a running total of US gold medals since 2004, and the right contains the previous and current Discus Throw champions. To calculate running totals and fetch previous rows' values without window functions, you'd have to write long, slow, and complex queries with multiple self-joins and subqueries. With window functions, you simply use one extra function, and you can calculate running totals or fetch previous rows' values.

# 3. Course outline

Let's go over the course's outline. In chapter 1, you'll learn what window functions are, the most common clauses that go with these functions, and two basic window functions. In chapter 2, you'll learn how to fetch, rank, and bin values in rows. In chapter 3, you'll learn to use familiar aggregate functions, such as SUM, as window functions, as well as how to define frames. Finally, in chapter 4, you'll learn techniques and functions that are useful when used with window functions.

# 4. Summer olympics dataset

Throughout this course, you'll query the Summer Olympics dataset, with each row representing an awarded medal. The columns contain the year, city, sport, discipline, event, athlete name, country, gender, and type of medal awarded.

# 5. Window functions

Let's dig in. Window functions perform an operation across a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row, which is the row the window function's currently operating on. They're similar to GROUP BY aggregate functions in that they span multiple rows, but instead of rows being grouped into a single row, all rows remain in the output. What are window functions used for? With window functions, you can easily do multiple things that are either quite complex or borderline impossible in SQL otherwise. For example, you can fetch values from rows before or after the current row. This could be used to determine if a competition's champion is reigning and to calculate growth over time. You can also assign ranks to rows, and calculate running totals and moving averages.

# 6. Row numbers

The most basic thing you can do with a window function is assign row numbers. Row numbers allow you to reference a row by its position or index as opposed to its values. You can fetch the 5th row no matter what its values are, for example. Assigning row numbers to this query's result would add an additional column with each row's number. How do you add this extra column?

# 7. Enter ROW_NUMBER

Enter ROW_NUMBER. ROW_NUMBER assigns a number to each row. The OVER clause indicates that it's a window function. In this query, ROW_NUMBER simply adds a column with each row's number or index.

# 8. Anatomy of a window function

Let's go over the anatomy of a window function like ROW_NUMBER. The OVER clause indicates that a function is a window function. The parentheses after OVER can be empty, just like the previous example, but they can also contain subclauses, such as ORDER BY, PARTITION BY, and ROWS or RANGE PRECEDING, FOLLOWING, or UNBOUNDED. These subclauses radically change the window function's output, and you'll learn about them in following videos.

# 9. Let's practice!

Now that you've been introduced to window functions, practice using them in the following exercises.

# Window functions vs GROUP BY

Which of the following is FALSE?

This choice is false because window functions take as input the rows of the table you're querying.

# Numbering rows

The simplest application for window functions is numbering rows. Numbering rows allows you to easily fetch the nth row. For example, it would be very difficult to get the 35th row in any given table if you didn't have a column with each row's number.

Number each row in the dataset.

```
SELECT
  *,
  -- Assign numbers to each row
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS Row_N
FROM Summer_Medals
ORDER BY Row_N ASC;
```

You've written your first window function.

# Numbering Olympic games in ascending order

The Summer Olympics dataset contains the results of the games between 1896 and 2012. The first Summer Olympics were held in 1896, the second in 1900, and so on. What if you want to easily query the table to see in which year the 13th Summer Olympics were held? You'd need to number the rows for that.

Assign a number to each year in which Summer Olympic games were held.

```
SELECT
  year,

  -- Assign numbers to each year
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS Row_N
FROM (
  SELECT year
  FROM summer_medals
  ORDER BY year ASC ) AS Years
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year ASC;
```

You've seen how row numbering works.
