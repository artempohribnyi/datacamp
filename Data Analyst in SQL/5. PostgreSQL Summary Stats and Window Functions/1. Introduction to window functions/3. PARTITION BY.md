# 1. PARTITION BY

You now know how to change the behavior of a window function with the ORDER BY subclause. Another way to change its behavior is with the PARTITION BY subclause.

# 2. Motivation

Let's build on last video's example to see why partitioning is useful. In addition to discus throw champions, this query includes triple jump champions as well. However, when using LAG, the first Triple Jump's Last_Champion is GER, Discus Throw's most recent champion, when in fact it should be null, since the two events are different and their champions are not related. How do you tell LAG to separate the two events?

# 3. Enter PARTITION BY

Enter PARTITION BY. This OVER subclause splits the table into partitions based on a column's unique values, similar to GROUP BY. Unlike GROUP BY, however, the results of a window function with PARTITION BY aren't rolled into one column. Partitions are operated on separately by the window function. For example, ROW_NUMBER will reset to 1 for each partition's first row, and LAG will only fetch a row's previous value if its previous row is in the same partition.

# 4. Partitioning by one column

Let's use PARTITION BY to fix this query's results. Adding PARTITION BY Event in the OVER clause before ORDER will separate the table into two partitions, one for Discus Throw and one for Triple Jump, the two unique values in the Event column. The one difference in the results is that the first row of the Triple Jump champions correctly has null as Last Champion. That's because it's the first row in its partition.

# 5. More complex partitioning

Let's look at a more complex partitioning. This result is a row numbering of Chinese and Japanese gold medals awarded to women. The row numbering extends across countries and events, and the goal is to reset it per country and year.

# 6. Partitioning by multiple columns

Partitioning by year and country in ROW_NUMBER will achieve this. Each combination of the unique values of Year and Country will be a partition. 2008 - China is one partition; 2008 - Japan is another, 2012 - China is yet another, and so on. As you can see in the result, the row number resets to 1 for each partition. You can partition by multiple columns if your groups are spread across columns.

# 7. Let's practice!

ORDER BY and PARTITION BY are the two most common subclauses used in window functions. Now that you know both, practice using them in the following assignments to master the basics of window functions.

# Reigning champions by gender

You've already fetched the previous year's champion for one event. However, if you have multiple events, genders, or other metrics as columns, you'll need to split your table into partitions to avoid having a champion from one event or gender appear as the previous champion of another event or gender.

Return the previous champions of each year's event by gender.

```
WITH Tennis_Gold AS (
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT Gender, 
    Year, 
    Country
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Year >= 2000 AND
    Event = 'Javelin Throw' AND
    Medal = 'Gold')

SELECT
  Gender, Year,
  Country AS Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion by gender
  LAG(country, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY year ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Tennis_Gold
ORDER BY Gender ASC, Year ASC;
```

Partitioning correctly split the champions by gender, so that data on champions of one gender does not get mixed into the other gender's results.

# Reigning champions by gender and event

In the previous exercise, you partitioned by gender to ensure that data about one gender doesn't get mixed into data about the other gender. If you have multiple columns, however, partitioning by only one of them will still mix the results of the other columns.

Return the previous champions of each year's events by gender and event.

```
WITH Athletics_Gold AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    Gender, Year, Event, Country
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Year >= 2000 AND
    Discipline = 'Athletics' AND
    Event IN ('100M', '10000M') AND
    Medal = 'Gold')

SELECT
  Gender, Year, Event,
  Country AS Champion,
  -- Fetch the previous year's champion by gender and event
  LAG(country, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY gender, event
            ORDER BY Year ASC) AS Last_Champion
FROM Athletics_Gold
ORDER BY Event ASC, Gender ASC, Year ASC;
```

You can partition by more than one column in case your groups are spread over several columns.

# Row numbers with partitioning

If you run ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY Medals DESC) on the following table, what row number would the 2008 Iranian record have?

| Year | Country | Medals |
|------|---------|--------|
| 2004 | IRN     | 32     |
| 2004 | LBN     | 17     |
| 2004 | KSA     | 4      |
| 2008 | IRQ     | 29     |
| 2008 | IRN     | 27     |
| 2008 | UAE     | 12     |

Since the table is partitioned by year, Iran is the second row in that partition.
