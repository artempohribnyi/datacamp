# 1. Correlated nested queries

So far the nested subquery in the inner block could be entirely solved before processing the outer select block. This is no longer the case for correlated nested queries.

# 2. Correlated queries

In a correlated query the condition in the WHERE clause of the inner query references some column of a table declared in the outer query. The nested query is then evaluated once for each row in the outer query. Let's give some examples.

# 3. Example correlated query

Assume we want to know which movies were rented more than 5 times. To answer this question we need information from the table movies and from the table renting as you can see in this query. As before, first, the inner select block is evaluated. In the WHERE clause of the inner select block, we refer to the table movies by using 'm-dot-movie id'. So this is a correlated query. To solve this correlated query the solver iterates through each row of the table movies and evaluates the subquery for the given value of movie_id. Note, that we need to use aliases for the table names in the inner and outer query.

# 4. Evaluate inner query

Here, we have the inner query evaluated for 'm-dot-movie_id' equal to one. The number of movie rentals for this movie is 8. This result is then passed to the outer query.

# 5. Evaluate outer query

In the outer query we check if 5 is smaller than the value from the inner query, which is the number of movie rentals. For movie_id = 1 we counted 8 movie rentals, since 5 is smaller than 8 the movie with ID one is listed in the results table. It's the movie 'One Night at McCools's'. Basically, a correlated query implements a looping mechanism. We are looping through the subquery for each row of the table defined in the outer query block.

# 6. Less than 5 movie rentals

We can also ask the question which movies were rented less than 5 times. Then we use in the WHERE clause of the outer query the expression 5 is larger than the number of movie rentals, which is the result of the inner query. The movie 'The Human Stain' with ID 17 is one of the movies with less than 5 rentals.

# 7. Let's practice!

Now you can try working with correlated nested queries yourself.

# Analyzing customer behavior

A new advertising campaign is going to focus on customers who rented fewer than 5 movies. Use a correlated query to extract all customer information for the customers of interest.

1. First, count number of movie rentals for customer with customer_id=45. Give the table renting the alias r.

```
-- Count movie rentals of customer 45
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM renting AS r
WHERE customer_id = 45;
```

2. Now select all columns from the customer table where the number of movie rentals is smaller than 5.

```
-- Select customers with less than 5 movie rentals
SELECT *
FROM customers as c
WHERE 5 > 
	(SELECT count(*)
	FROM renting as r
	WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id);
```

You managed to use a correlated query to identify the customers of interest.

# Customers who gave low ratings

Identify customers who were not satisfied with movies they watched on MovieNow. Report a list of customers with minimum rating smaller than 4.

1. Calculate the minimum rating of customer with ID 7.

```
-- Calculate the minimum rating of customer with ID 7
SELECT MIN(rating)
FROM renting AS r
WHERE r.customer_id = 7;
```

2. Select all customers with a minimum rating smaller than 4. Use the first letter of the table as an alias.

```
SELECT *
FROM customers AS c
WHERE 4 > -- Select all customers with a minimum rating smaller than 4 
	(SELECT MIN(rating)
	FROM renting AS r
	WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id);
```

You found out that Sidney Généreux, Zara Mitchell, Albin Jaworski, and Robin J. Himes rated a movie with less than 4.

# Movies and ratings with correlated queries

Report a list of movies that received the most attention on the movie platform, (i.e. report all movies with more than 5 ratings and all movies with an average rating higher than 8).

1. Select all movies with more than 5 ratings. Use the first letter of the table as an alias.

```
SELECT *
FROM movies AS m
WHERE 5 < -- Select all movies with more than 5 ratings
	(SELECT COUNT(rating)
	FROM renting AS r
	WHERE m.movie_id = r.movie_id);
```

2. Select all movies with an average rating higher than 8.

```
SELECT *
FROM movies AS m
WHERE 8 < -- Select all movies with an average rating higher than 8
	(SELECT AVG(rating)
	FROM renting AS r
	WHERE r.movie_id = m.movie_id);
```

You use correlated queries to figure out that the comedy 'What women want' has an average rating higher than 8. Note, that you didn't need to use a GROUP BY clause to answer this reques
