# 1. Queries with UNION and INTERSECT

In this lesson we will look at the functions UNION and INTERSECT.

# 2. UNION

Let's first review how the set operator UNION works. We have two tables, table 1 has the elements A, B, C, and D and table 2 the elements D, E, and F. The union of those tables are the elements A, B, C, D, E, and F. So, the union is the set of all values that are either in table 1 or in table 2 or in both. We don't have any duplicates in the UNION of two sets or tables.

# 3. Example - UNION

Here we have an example of the UNION of two tables. The first table consists of title, genre and renting price of all movies with a renting price higher than 2.8. The second table consists of the title, genre, and renting price of all movies with genre Actions and Adventure. Note that it is crucial for the UNION operator that the same columns are selected in both tables.

# 4. Example - UNION

The result of this UNION are all movies which have either a renting price higher than 2.8 or are Action and Adventure movies as we can see from the first three rows.

# 5. INTERSECT

To review how INTERSECT works, let's have a look again at the two tables, table 1 with the elements A, B, C, and D and table 2 with D, E, and F. The intersect of those tables consists only of D. The intersect is the set of all values that appear in both tables.

# 6. Example - INTERSECT

This is an example of the INTERSECT of two tables. We take the same two tables as in the previous example but instead of the UNION we create the INTERSECT of those tables. The result of this INTERSECT is only the movie Astro Boy which has a renting price higher than 2.8 and is an Action and Adventure movie.

# 7. Let's practice!

Now, let's work with the set operators UNION and INTERSECT.

# Young actors not coming from the USA

As you've just seen, the operators UNION and INTERSECT are powerful tools when you work with two or more tables. Identify actors who are not from the USA and actors who were born after 1990.

1. Report the name, nationality and the year of birth of all actors who are not from the USA.

```
SELECT name,  -- Report the name, nationality and the year of birth
       nationality, 
       year_of_birth
FROM actors
WHERE nationality != 'USA'; -- Of all actors who are not from the USA
```

2. Report the name, nationality and the year of birth of all actors who were born after 1990.

```
SELECT name, 
       nationality, 
       year_of_birth
FROM actors
WHERE year_of_birth > 1990; -- Born after 1990
```

3. Select all actors who are not from the USA and all actors who are born after 1990.

```
SELECT name, 
       nationality, 
       year_of_birth
FROM actors
WHERE nationality <> 'USA'
UNION -- Select all actors who are not from the USA and all actors who are born after 1990
SELECT name, 
       nationality, 
       year_of_birth
FROM actors
WHERE year_of_birth > 1990;
```

4. Select all actors who are not from the USA and who are also born after 1990.

```
SELECT name, 
       nationality, 
       year_of_birth
FROM actors
WHERE nationality <> 'USA'
INTERSECT -- Select all actors who are not from the USA and who are also born after 1990
SELECT name, 
       nationality, 
       year_of_birth
FROM actors
WHERE year_of_birth > 1990;
```

You identified Freddie Highmore as the only actor who is not from the USA and born after 1990.

# Dramas with high ratings

The advertising team has a new focus. They want to draw the attention of the customers to dramas. Make a list of all movies that are in the drama genre and have an average rating higher than 9.

1. Select the IDs of all dramas.

```

2. Select the IDs of all movies with average rating higher than 9.

```
SELECT m.movie_id -- Select the IDs of all movies with average rating higher than 9
FROM movies AS m
GROUP BY m.movie_id
HAVING 9 <
    (SELECT AVG(rating)
        FROM renting AS r
        WHERE r.movie_id = m.movie_id);
```

SELECT movie_id
FROM renting
GROUP BY movie_id
HAVING AVG(rating)>9;
```
