# 1. Final example

Let us now bring everything that you've learned in this course together. The goal is always to help management make informed and data driven decisions.

# 2. Business Case

MovieNow considers investing money in new movies. It is more expensive to add recent movies than it is to add older ones. So the first step in our data analysis is to investigate the preference of customers for movies depending on the year the movie was released. We will produce a table to see if customers give better ratings to recent movies, and if there is a difference across countries.

# 3. 1. Join data

The first step is to join the data we need for the analysis. We get information about movie ratings from the table renting, the country of the customer from the table customers and the year of release of the movies from the table movies.

# 4. 2. Select relevant records

Next we select only the rows required for the analysis. We restrict the table to the movies that have at least 4 ratings. Therefore, we use a nested query in the WHERE clause for movie_id. The nested query selects the movie IDs from movies with a rating at least equal to four from the table renting. We have another restriction: the date of the movie rental has to be April 1st 2018 or later.

# 5. 3. Aggregation

The final step is the aggregation of the data. To get a good overview we choose three different types of aggregation. We count the number of movie rentals, the number of different movies and the average rating. We're using hierarchical level of aggregation: we go from a big overview to more detailed observations. We will calculate the total aggregation, the aggregation for movies by year of release, and finally the aggregation for movies from each year of release depending on the country of the customers.

# 6. 3. Aggregation

In the SELECT clause we have the three different levels of aggregation: the number of movie rentals, the number of distinct movies and the average rating. In the last but one row we GROUP BY ROLLUP first on the year of release, and then on the country to obtain the required levels of aggregation. In the final row we order the results by country and year of release.

# 7. Resulting table

Here are the last few lines of the resulting table. In the last line we can see the total aggregation with 333 movie rentals, 50 different movies and an average rating of 7.9. The remaining rows are aggregations for the year of release ordered by increasing year. A statistical analysis could be performed to investigate possible trends, but intuitively we can already see that there is no clear pattern of better ratings for movies with later year of release.

# 8. Let's practice!

It is necessary to further investigate in which kind of movies the new budget should be invested. Let's find out the answer!

# Customer preference for genres

You just saw that customers have no clear preference for more recent movies over older ones. Now the management considers investing money in movies of the best rated genres.

1. Augment the records of movie rentals with information about movies. Use the first letter of the table as alias.

```
SELECT *
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN movies AS m -- Augment the table with information about movies
ON r.movie_id = m.movie_id;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/e11b8ae1-6c44-4bfb-9897-160bf94173ec)

2. Select records of movies with at least 4 ratings, starting from 2018-04-01.

```
SELECT *
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE r.movie_id IN ( -- Select records of movies with at least 4 ratings
	SELECT movie_id
	FROM renting
	GROUP BY movie_id
	HAVING COUNT(rating) >= 4)
AND date_renting > '2018-04-01'; -- Select records of movie rentals since 2018-04-01
```

3. For each genre, calculate the average rating (use the alias avg_rating), the number of ratings (use the alias n_rating), the number of movie rentals (use the alias n_rentals), and the number of distinct movies (use the alias n_movies).

```
SELECT m.genre, -- For each genre, calculate:
	   AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating, -- The average rating and use the alias avg_rating
	   COUNT(r.rating) AS n_rating, -- The number of ratings and use the alias n_rating
	   COUNT(*) n_rentals,     -- The number of movie rentals and use the alias n_rentals
	   COUNT(DISTINCT m.movie_id) AS n_movies -- The number of distinct movies and use the alias n_movies
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE r.movie_id IN ( 
	SELECT movie_id
	FROM renting
	GROUP BY movie_id
	HAVING COUNT(rating) >= 3)
AND r.date_renting >= '2018-01-01'
GROUP BY m.genre;
```

4. Order the table by decreasing average rating.

```
SELECT genre,
	   AVG(rating) AS avg_rating,
	   COUNT(rating) AS n_rating,
       COUNT(*) AS n_rentals,     
	   COUNT(DISTINCT m.movie_id) AS n_movies 
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE r.movie_id IN ( 
	SELECT movie_id
	FROM renting
	GROUP BY movie_id
	HAVING COUNT(rating) >= 3 )
AND r.date_renting >= '2018-01-01'
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC; -- Order the table by decreasing average rating
```

You found out that Action & Adventure has the highest rating.

# Customer preference for actors

The last aspect you have to analyze are customer preferences for certain actors.

1. Join the tables.

```
-- Join the tables
SELECT *
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN actsin AS ai
ON r.movie_id = ai.movie_id
LEFT JOIN actors AS a
ON ai.actor_id = a.actor_id;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/08f295e5-ba2c-4a39-8132-1a1bc1dd2861)

2. For each combination of the actors' nationality and gender, calculate the average rating, the number of ratings, the number of movie rentals, and the number of actors.

```
SELECT a.nationality,
       a.gender,
	   AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating, -- The average rating
	   COUNT(r.rating) AS n_rating, -- The number of ratings
	   COUNT(*) AS n_rentals, -- The number of movie rentals
	   COUNT(DISTINCT a.actor_id) AS n_actors -- The number of actors
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN actsin AS ai
ON ai.movie_id = r.movie_id
LEFT JOIN actors AS a
ON ai.actor_id = a.actor_id
WHERE r.movie_id IN ( 
	SELECT movie_id
	FROM renting
	GROUP BY movie_id
	HAVING COUNT(rating) >=4 )
AND r.date_renting >= '2018-04-01'
GROUP BY a.nationality, a.gender; -- Report results for each combination of the actors' nationality and gender
```

3. Provide results for all aggregation levels represented in a pivot table.

```
SELECT a.nationality,
       a.gender,
	   AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating,
	   COUNT(r.rating) AS n_rating,
	   COUNT(*) AS n_rentals,
	   COUNT(DISTINCT a.actor_id) AS n_actors
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN actsin AS ai
ON ai.movie_id = r.movie_id
LEFT JOIN actors AS a
ON ai.actor_id = a.actor_id
WHERE r.movie_id IN ( 
	SELECT movie_id
	FROM renting
	GROUP BY movie_id
	HAVING COUNT(rating) >= 4)
AND r.date_renting >= '2018-04-01'
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((a.nationality, a.gender), a.nationality, a.gender, ()); -- Provide results for all aggregation levels represented in a pivot table
```

You sent your report on customer preferences to management. Now they can take an informed, data-driven decision based on your detailed analysis. Congratulations!
