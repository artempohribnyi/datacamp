# 1. ROLLUP

Great job using CUBE! ROLLUP is the next operator that we will introduce to facilitate the execution of OLAP queries.

# 2. Table renting_extended

Again, we will focus on the table renting_extended to demonstrate the ROLLUP operator.

# 3. Query with ROLLUP

The ROLLUP operator is always used in combination with a GROUP BY statement. Parentheses around the two column names have to be used. This query returns a table with different levels of aggregation. We get the number of movie rentals for each combination of country and genre, the number of rentals for each country and the total number of rentals.

# 4. Query with ROLLUP

In the ROLLUP operator the order of the column names between parentheses is important. The first column is aggregated on two levels, but the second column is aggregated on only one level. Here we have the resulting table. Note that, now, the aggregation for each genre is not reported. This is the key difference with the CUBE operator, where the aggregates for all combinations of values of the selected attribute types are shown.

# 5. Order in ROLLUP

When we change the order and put genre first and country second we obtain this table. The last two lines are now changed: instead of the aggregation for country we now have the aggregation for genre.

# 6. Summary ROLLUP

The motivation for this type of aggregation is to present data on different levels of detail. ROLLUP returns aggregates for a hierarchy of value. When we go from aggregation for each country and genre to aggregation for each country alone, and then to the total number of movie rentals, we drop a level of detail at each step. Because we have these levels of aggregation the order of the column names in the ROLLUP clause is important.

# 7. Number of rentals and ratings

We can also include more than one aggregation in the table. Here we count the number of movie rentals and the number of ratings. In the result table we can see the corresponding numbers in columns n_rentals and n_ratings.

# 8. Let's practice!

Now, it's your turn to aggregate data with the ROLLUP operator!

# Number of customers

You have to give an overview of the number of customers for a presentation.

Generate a table with the total number of customers, the number of customers for each country, and the number of female and male customers for each country.
Order the result by country and gender.

```
-- Count the total number of customers, the number of customers for each country, and the number of female and male customers for each country
SELECT country,
       gender,
	   COUNT(*)
FROM customers
GROUP BY ROLLUP (country, gender)
ORDER BY country, gender; -- Order the result by country and gender
```

You aggregated the data on different levels and found out that there are 3 female customers and 1 male customer from Austria, so in total 4 customers from Austria.

# Analyzing preferences of genres across countries

You are asked to study the preferences of genres across countries. Are there particular genres which are more popular in specific countries? Evaluate the preferences of customers by averaging their ratings and counting the number of movies rented from each genre.

1. Augment the renting records with information about movies and customers.

```
-- Join the tables
SELECT *
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON r.movie_id = m.movie_id
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

2. Calculate the average ratings and the number of ratings for each country and each genre. Include the columns country and genre in the SELECT clause.

```
SELECT 
	c.country, -- Select country
	m.genre, -- Select genre
	AVG(r.rating), -- Average ratings
	COUNT(*)  -- Count number of movie rentals
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.country, m.genre -- Aggregate for each country and each genre
ORDER BY c.country, m.genre;
```

3. Finally, calculate the average ratings and the number of ratings for each country and genre, as well as an aggregation over all genres for each country and the overall average and total number.

```
-- Group by each county and genre with OLAP extension
SELECT 
	c.country, 
	m.genre, 
	AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating, 
	COUNT(*) AS num_rating
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY ROLLUP (c.country, m.genre)
ORDER BY c.country, m.genre;
```

You gathered all the information of interest by using a ROLLUP statement.
