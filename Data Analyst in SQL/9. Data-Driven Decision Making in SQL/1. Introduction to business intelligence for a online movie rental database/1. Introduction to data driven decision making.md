he first chapter is an introduction to the use case of an online movie rental company, called MovieNow and focuses on using simple SQL queries to extract and aggregated data from its database.

# 1. Introduction to data driven decision making

Welcome to this course on data driven decision making. My name is Irene Ortner and together with Profesor Bart Baesens and Professor Tim Verdonck we will guide you through this course.

# 2. Aim of this course

We assume that you are already familiar with basic SQL queries. Still, we will quickly refresh some basic SQL statements and you will learn how you can apply them to extract valuable business insights from your data. Then you will learn about new SQL techniques to summarize data such as the SQL OLAP extensions the CUBE, ROLLUP and GROUPING SETS operators which are specifically developed as business intelligence tools.

# 3. MovieNow: an online movie rental company

Throughout this course, we will work with a Postgres database from a fictional movie rental company called MovieNow. MovieNow offers an online platform for streaming movies. Customers can rent a movie for 24 hours. For all movies, the company stores additional information such as the genre or the main actors. MovieNow also stores information about customers and movie ratings.

# 4. MovieNow data structure

Here we will give an overview of the tables in the database. First, in the 'customers' table, we have a column 'customer_id', a number which is a unique identifier for each customer, then we have name, country, gender and date of birth. The final column is the date when the account for MovieNow was created.

# 5. MovieNow data structure

The columns for the table 'movies' include a unique identifier movie_id, the title of the movie, the movie genre, the runtime, the release year, and, finally, what it costs to rent the movie.

# 6. MovieNow data structure

The table 'renting' records all movie rentals. 'renting_id' is a unique identifier for each movie rental. The column 'customer_id' tells us which customer rented the movie and 'movie_id' tells us which movie the customer rented. The rating a customer gives after watching the movie is stored in the column 'rating' which has values between 1 and 10, where 10 is the best rating. The final column is the rental date.

# 7. MovieNow data structure

The table 'actors' contains information about the actors in the movies. Besides the unique identifier 'actor_id', we have the actor's name, year of birth, nationality, and gender.

# 8. MovieNow data structure

The table 'actsin' shows which actor appears in which movie. Besides the unique identifier actsin_id, it includes movie_id and actor_id.

# 9. Objectives of data driven decision making

Data-driven decision making achieves short-term and long-term goals. We can extract valuable information from data to support operational short-term decisions. For example, the popularity of certain actors helps MovieNow decide whether to purchase certain movies. Also, last month's revenue can be important information supporting decisions regarding short-term investments. For long-term decisions, data-driven support can provide information regarding customer growth and successes in certain regions in the past, which can inform company decisions regarding when and where the market can be expanded in the future. Also, knowing the long-term development of overall revenue helps MovieNow plan long-term investments.

# 10. KPIs: Key Performance Indicators

Key performance indicators help a company (or its subdivisions) define and monitor success. Revenue is a trivial indicator of success. For MovieNow, this is calculated as the sum of the price for rented movies. For the subdivision customer relations management, the KPI 'customer satisfaction' could be quantified by the average rating of all movies or the KPI 'customer engagement' as the number of active customers in a certain time period. In this course, you will learn how to define KPIs, extract information from the data, and monitor it over time. This will help decision making using hard facts.

# 11. Let's get started!

Now you can start exploring the database yourself.

# Exploring the database

Explore the tables and its columns. Which of the following quantities can't be computed?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/803209a5-05de-419f-ba32-a213f91a5d60)

There is no information about movie awards in the data.

# Exploring the table renting

The table renting includes all records of movie rentals. Each record has a unique ID renting_id. It also contains information about customers (customer_id) and which movies they watched (movie_id). Furthermore, customers can give a rating after watching the movie, and the day the movie was rented is recorded.

1. Select all columns from renting.

```
SELECT *  -- Select all
FROM renting;        -- From table renting
```

2. Now select only those columns from renting which are needed to calculate the average rating per movie.

```
SELECT movie_id,  -- Select all columns needed to compute the average rating per movie
       rating
FROM renting;
```

3. Question
In SQL missing values are coded with null. In which column of renting did you notice null values?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/5d1e9300-d6e5-40b5-82f7-2e456159c4c1)

The column rating in the renting table has a lot of null values since not every customer gives a rating after watching a movie.
