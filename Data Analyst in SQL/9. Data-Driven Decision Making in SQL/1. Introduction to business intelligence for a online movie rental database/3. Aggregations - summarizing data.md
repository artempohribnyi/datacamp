# 1. Aggregations - summarizing data

For decision making, it is usually not important to look at individual records, but rather to examine summaries of certain groups. For example, we will look at the average rating or count the number of views of a movie, rather than looking at each rating and movie rental separately.

# 2. Overview aggregations

In this query, the column renting_price from the table movies is aggregated by using the AVG function - short for average. So we get the average price for renting a movie.

# 3. Overview aggregations

Here is a list of some more aggregate functions which we will use in this course: SUM, COUNT, MIN, and MAX.

# 4. Aggregation with NULL values

SELECT COUNT star counts the number of rows of the selected table 'actors'. The result is 145. Applying the function COUNT() to a column returns the number of not NULL values in this column. So we get the same result when we count the number of entries in the column 'name', since there are no NULL values in this column. The column year_of_birth has two NULL values. That's why the third query returns 143 instead of 145. Also with the aggregate functions AVG, SUM, MIN, or MAX the NULL values are always ignored.

# 5. DISTINCT

Another very useful keyword is DISTINCT. If we want to filter out duplicates and only look at unique values then we can add the keyword DISTINCT to the query. For example, we select the distinct countries from the customer table, showing us all countries where customers come from. Then we can count the distinct countries, which gives us the result 11.

# 6. DISTINCT with `NULL` values

From this query we can learn two things about NULL values. The column rating from the table renting has values 1 to 10 or null. 'DISTINCT rating' lists all of these values including NULL. The last line of the query orders the resulting table by the values of rating. It is ordered ascending and null is at the final position, so null is treated as the largest value when we order it.

# 7. Give an alias to column names

In the SELECT clause, the term AS can be added to define names of a column in the return table. These new column names are also called aliases or shortcut names. Using alias names makes the resulting table more self-explanatory. In this result table we have the average price and the number of genres.

# 8. Let's practice!

Now it's time to put what you just learned into practice.

# Summarizing customer information

In most business decisions customers are analyzed in groups, such as customers per country or customers per age group.

1. Count the number of customers born in the 80s.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) -- Count the total number of customers
FROM customers
WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN '1980-01-01' and '1989-12-31'; -- Select customers born between 1980-01-01 and 1989-12-31
```

2. Count the number of customers from Germany.

```
SELECT COUNT(*)   -- Count the total number of customers
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Germany'; -- Select all customers from Germany
```

3. Count the number of countries where MovieNow has customers.

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country)   -- Count the number of countries
FROM customers;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/30892c7d-b2fc-4c75-aa8c-4b98c1885167)

You aggregated data from the customers table and figured out that MovieNow has customers in 11 countries and that there are no customers from Germany.

# Ratings of movie 25

The movie ratings give us insight into the preferences of our customers. Report summary statistics, such as the minimum, maximum, average, and count, of ratings for the movie with ID 25.

Select all movie rentals of the movie with movie_id 25 from the table renting.
For those records, calculate the minimum, maximum and average rating and count the number of ratings for this movie.

```
SELECT MIN(rating) min_rating, -- Calculate the minimum rating and use alias min_rating
	   MAX(rating) max_rating, -- Calculate the maximum rating and use alias max_rating
	   AVG(rating) avg_rating, -- Calculate the average rating and use alias avg_rating
	   COUNT(rating) number_ratings -- Count the number of ratings and use alias number_ratings
FROM renting
WHERE movie_id = 25; -- Select all records of the movie with ID 25
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/f957bf90-5a55-4bfb-b41a-1d21e4c3259c)

You summarized the ratings for the movie 25 and used meaningful column names. This movie has 8 ratings with minimum 5, maximum 10 and average 7.5 rating.

# Examining annual rentals

You are asked to provide a report about the development of the company. Specifically, your manager is interested in the total number of movie rentals, the total number of ratings and the average rating of all movies since the beginning of 2019.

1. First, select all records of movie rentals since January 1st 2019.

```
SELECT * -- Select all records of movie rentals since January 1st 2019
FROM renting
WHERE date_renting >= '2019-01-01'; 
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/460d82fd-fa45-44c9-b14d-29adf3b7d622)

2. Now, count the number of movie rentals and calculate the average rating since the beginning of 2019.

```
SELECT 
	COUNT(*), -- Count the total number of rented movies
	AVG(rating) -- Add the average rating
FROM renting
WHERE date_renting >= '2019-01-01';
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/adb51d80-e39f-4dc1-9341-80141b8e4aaa)

3. Use as alias column names number_renting and average_rating respectively.

```
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS number_renting, -- Give it the column name number_renting
	AVG(rating) AS average_rating  -- Give it the column name average_rating
FROM renting
WHERE date_renting >= '2019-01-01';
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/279f61cf-ea0a-452f-89a4-8d30a0872408)

4. Finally, count how many ratings exist since 2019-01-01.

```
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS number_renting,
	AVG(rating) AS average_rating, 
    COUNT(rating) AS number_ratings -- Add the total number of ratings here.
FROM renting
WHERE date_renting >= '2019-01-01';
```

You managed to extract all KPIs from the renting records by working with aggregations, NULL values and dates.
