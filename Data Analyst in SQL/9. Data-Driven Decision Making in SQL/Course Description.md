In this course, you will learn how to use SQL to support decision making. It is based on a case study about an online movie rental company with a database about customer information, movie ratings, background information on actors and more. You will learn to apply SQL queries to study for example customer preferences, customer engagement, and sales development. This course also covers SQL extensions for online analytical processing (OLAP), which makes it easier to obtain key insights from multidimensional aggregated data.
