# 1. Identify favorite actors of customer groups

In this lesson, we will combine different SQL statements to complex queries and explore who the favorite actors for certain customer groups are.

# 2. Combining SQL statements in one query

In one query, we will combine now LEFT JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY statements.

# 3. From renting records to customer and actor information

First, we need to prepare all information we need to answer the following question: "Who is the favorite actor for a certain customer group?" We take the table 'renting' and use a LEFT JOIN to augment it with information about actors and customers. Since the table 'actors' cannot be matched with 'renting' directly, we need to JOIN 'renting' with 'actsin' first by 'movie_id', then we can join actors by 'actor_id'. This joined table will be the basis for the next queries.

# 4. Male customers

From the joined table, we select only the customers with the gender 'male' as you can see in the second to last row. Then we group by the actors' names with 'GROUP BY a-dot-name'. In the first line, you can see that we report the actors' names and, for each actor, count how often their movies are watched by male customers.

# 5. Who is the favorite actor?

We can now ask, "What makes an actor the favorite actor?" Is it being watched most often as we assumed in the last query? An alternative definition could be that the movies in which they appear get the best ratings. This can be easily included in the table by adding the third line in this query, that is average of rating.

# 6. Add HAVING and ORDER BY

There are actors who only appear in movies without a rating. These actors will get 'NULL' as an average rating. If we want to exclude these actors, we can do so by using the HAVING clause: HAVING average rating IS NOT NULL. Note the difference between the WHERE clause, which is applied to the table before the aggregation, and the HAVING clause which is applied after the aggregation with GROUP BY. The final line orders the result table such that the highest average rating comes first and for the same average rating the highest number of views comes first.

# 7. Add HAVING and ORDER BY

In our fictional movie database, Ray Romano is the favorite actor among male customers, receiving the best possible rating of 10 - but only with 3 views.

# 8. Let's practice!

Here you saw how to combine several SQL statements to answer the question "Who is the favorite actor?". Now it's your turn to answer the question "Which is the favorite movie?".


# Identify favorite movies for a group of customers

Which is the favorite movie on MovieNow? Answer this question for a specific group of customers: for all customers born in the 70s.

1. Augment the table renting with customer information and information about the movies.
For each join use the first letter of the table name as alias.

```
SELECT *
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c   -- Add customer information
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN movies AS m   -- Add movie information
ON r.movie_id = m.movie_id;
```

2. Select only those records of customers born in the 70s.

```
SELECT *
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN '1970-01-01' AND '1979-12-31' ; -- Select customers born in the 70s
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/61919e5e-bb6e-4f29-a558-45f9e6be8f26)

3. For each movie, report the number of times it was rented, as well as the average rating. Limit your results to customers born in the 1970s.

```
SELECT m.title, 
COUNT(*), -- Report number of views per movie
AVG(r.rating) -- Report the average rating per movie
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE c.date_of_birth BETWEEN '1970-01-01' AND '1979-12-31'
GROUP BY m.title;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/9693583f-67a3-4ceb-a45f-b24fd2b20e20)

4. Remove those movies from the table with only one rental.
Order the result table such that movies with highest rating come first.

```
SELECT m.title, 
COUNT(*),
AVG(r.rating)
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE c.date_of_birth BETWEEN '1970-01-01' AND '1979-12-31'
GROUP BY m.title
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 -- Remove movies with only one rental
ORDER BY AVG(r.rating) DESC; -- Order with highest rating first
```

You just wrote a query with LEFT JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY. And you found out that 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is a movie with one of the best ratings among people born in the 70s.

# Identify favorite actors for Spain

You're now going to explore actor popularity in Spain. Use as alias the first letter of the table, except for the table actsin use ai instead.

1. Augment the table renting with information about customers and actors.

```
SELECT *
FROM renting as r 
LEFT JOIN customers AS c  -- Augment table renting with information about customers 
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN actsin AS ai  -- Augment the table renting with the table actsin
ON r.movie_id = ai.movie_id
LEFT JOIN actors AS a  -- Augment table renting with information about actors
ON ai.actor_id = a.actor_id;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/6e3c1e75-a3b9-40b6-80df-9cef49b69389)

2. Report the number of movie rentals and the average rating for each actor, separately for male and female customers.
Report only actors with more than 5 movie rentals.

```
SELECT a.name,  c.gender,
       COUNT(*) AS number_views, 
       AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM renting as r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN actsin as ai
ON r.movie_id = ai.movie_id
LEFT JOIN actors as a
ON ai.actor_id = a.actor_id

GROUP BY a.name, c.gender -- For each actor, separately for male and female customers
HAVING AVG(r.rating) IS NOT NULL 
AND COUNT(*) > 5 -- Report only actors with more than 5 movie rentals
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, number_views DESC;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/b0922f78-ccca-49aa-9573-30348f8ae317)

3. Now, report the favorite actors only for customers from Spain.

```
SELECT a.name,  c.gender,
       COUNT(*) AS number_views, 
       AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM renting as r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN actsin as ai
ON r.movie_id = ai.movie_id
LEFT JOIN actors as a
ON ai.actor_id = a.actor_id
WHERE c.country = 'Spain' -- Select only customers from Spain
GROUP BY a.name, c.gender
HAVING AVG(r.rating) IS NOT NULL 
  AND COUNT(*) > 5 
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, number_views DESC;
```

You found out that in this table Catherine Keener is the favorite actress among female Spain customers and that male customers from Spain like the actors from Harry Potter best: Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint.

# KPIs per country

In chapter 1 you were asked to provide a report about the development of the company. This time you have to prepare a similar report with KPIs for each country separately. Your manager is interested in the total number of movie rentals, the average rating of all movies and the total revenue for each country since the beginning of 2019.

1. Augment the table renting with information about customers and movies.
Use as alias the first latter of the table name.
Select only records about rentals since beginning of 2019.

```
SELECT *
FROM renting AS r -- Augment the table renting with information about customers
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN movies AS m -- Augment the table renting with information about movies
ON r.movie_id = m.movie_id
WHERE date_renting >= '2019-01-01'; -- Select only records about rentals since the beginning of 2019
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/6dffec1e-bf50-4654-8a86-6b15726679e0)

2. Calculate the number of movie rentals.
Calculate the average rating.
Calculate the revenue from movie rentals.
Report these KPIs for each country.

```
SELECT 
	c.country,                    -- For each country report
	COUNT(*) AS number_renting, -- The number of movie rentals
	AVG(r.rating) AS average_rating, -- The average rating
	SUM(m.renting_price) AS revenue  -- The revenue from movie rentals
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
LEFT JOIN movies AS m
ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE date_renting >= '2019-01-01'
GROUP BY c.country;
```

You calculated a total revenue of 57.94 for Spain, with 26 movie rentals and an average rating of 8.1.
