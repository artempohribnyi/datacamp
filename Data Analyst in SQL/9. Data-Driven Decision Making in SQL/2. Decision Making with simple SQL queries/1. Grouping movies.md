More complex queries with GROUP BY, LEFT JOIN and sub-queries are used to gain insight into customer preferences.

# 1. Grouping movies

In this lesson, we will use queries with the GROUP BY clause. Using the GROUP BY clause allows us to apply aggregations to groups in a table.

# 2. GROUP BY Applications

To evaluate the success and the potential of a company, it is often desirable to look at groups of customers or groups of products jointly. We could be interested in grouping customers – for example by country or gender - or in grouping movies by genre or year of release. We will now look at an example where we are interested in the average renting price by genre.

# 3. Table: movies_selected

Here we extracted a subset of the 'movies' table for illustration. We call this table 'movies_selected'. In this table, we have the movie's name, its genre and rental price. Now, we are interested in the average price of renting a movie for each genre. We will do this step using the GROUP BY clause.

# 4. GROUP BY

This is the basic SQL query with GROUP BY. We select the genre from the table movies_selected and group it by genre. By itself, the result is not different than what you get with the SELECT DISTINCT statement, but with the GROUP BY clause, we can add aggregation functions to the SELECT component, such as average, sum, minimum or maximum.

# 5. Average renting price

We are interested in the average price per genre, so we add the average of the prices in the SELECT component and give it the alias avg_price. We obtain a table with the genres and the average price per genre. To better understand what this query does, let’s go back to the table movies_selected.

# 6. movies_selected table

We can think of a GROUP BY statement as a split into subgroups. The colors of the rows in the table illustrate the different genres. The GROUP BY genre clause creates groups based on the genre.

# 7. movies_selected table split

as you can see here - every group is in a separate table. We have groups for the genres Fantasy, Drama, and so on. Then we can apply any aggregation function to each of the sub-tables. Besides the average, which we used before, we can additionally use COUNT to get the number of movies in each sub-table, for example 3 for Fantasy and 4 for Drama.

# 8. Average rental price and number of movies

This is the query extended by the number of movies in each category. We have used COUNT with an asterisk before to count all rows in a query. Now we use it to count the number of movies for each genre.

# 9. HAVING

The HAVING clause can be added to a GROUP BY statement to retrieve the values of only those groups which satisfy specified conditions. It is only used in combination with a GROUP BY clause and can include aggregate functions such as sum, average or count. In this example, only those rows of the table are selected where the number of columns is larger than 2 or with other words where the number of movies is greater than 2.

# 10. Let's practice!

And now it's your turn to group and aggregate data from the customer and renting tables.

# First account for each country.

Conduct an analysis to see when the first customer accounts were created for each country.

Create a table with a row for each country and columns for the country name and the date when the first customer account was created.
Use the alias first_account for the column with the dates.
Order by date in ascending order.

```
SELECT country, -- For each country report the earliest date when an account was created
	MIN(date_account_start) AS first_account
FROM customers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY first_account;
```

You learned that the first customer account was created in France.

# Average movie ratings

For each movie the average rating, the number of ratings and the number of views has to be reported. Generate a table with meaningful column names.

1. Group the data in the table renting by movie_id and report the ID and the average rating.

```
SELECT movie_id, 
       AVG(rating)   -- Calculate average rating per movie
FROM renting
GROUP BY movie_id;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/ebd387a6-8649-4b50-8ac5-3d48c5902714)

2. Add two columns for the number of ratings and the number of movie rentals to the results table.
Use alias names avg_rating, number_rating and number_renting for the corresponding columns.

```
SELECT movie_id, 
       AVG(rating) AS avg_rating, -- Use as alias avg_rating
       COUNT(rating) AS number_rating,                -- Add column for number of ratings with alias number_rating
       COUNT(*) AS number_renting                -- Add column for number of movie rentals with alias number_renting
FROM renting
GROUP BY movie_id;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/d4581cdf-ce6e-4a79-bb46-5baaa1b2f7e9)

3. Order the rows of the table by the average rating such that it is in decreasing order.
Observe what happens to NULL values.

```
SELECT movie_id, 
       AVG(rating) AS avg_rating,
       COUNT(rating) AS number_ratings,
       COUNT(*) AS number_renting
FROM renting
GROUP BY movie_id
ORDER BY AVG(rating) DESC; -- Order by average rating in decreasing order
```

4. Question
Which statement is true for the movie with average rating null?
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/d48adaa1-3a05-468d-b3c4-64a87a4537c7)

```
SELECT 
    movie_id,
    rating
FROM renting
WHERE movie_id = 11;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/07fd0b24-d7b0-4bbf-8194-1cf83bd30fe2)

The average is null only if all values are null.

# Average rating per customer

Similar to what you just did, you will now look at the average movie ratings, this time for customers. So you will obtain a table with the average rating given by each customer. Further, you will include the number of ratings and the number of movie rentals per customer. You will report these summary statistics only for customers with more than 7 movie rentals and order them in ascending order by the average rating.

Group the data in the table renting by customer_id and report the customer_id, the average rating, the number of ratings and the number of movie rentals.
Select only customers with more than 7 movie rentals.
Order the resulting table by the average rating in ascending order.

```
SELECT customer_id, -- Report the customer_id
      AVG(rating),  -- Report the average rating per customer
      COUNT(rating),  -- Report the number of ratings per customer
      COUNT(*)  -- Report the number of movie rentals per customer
FROM renting
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 7 -- Select only customers with more than 7 movie rentals
ORDER BY AVG(rating); -- Order by the average rating in ascending order
```

You found out that customer number 104 gave the lowest average ratings for 4 movies.
