# 1. Case study: report on credit risk

Good job! Let's go through a small case study now.

# 2. Credit risk

We're going to decide step by step how to write a report on a credit risk case. So let's present the case. Credit risk quantifies the probability that a customer fails to meet contractual obligations, such as credit card debts, and other loans. The finance team of a fictional Bank, Loanme, is interested in understanding and predicting which customer taking on a loan is more likely to default. They send us data available on loan details and borrowers, including age, income, loan amount, that we use to perform data exploration, and to train and evaluate a predictive model. Now it's time to show our results.

# 3. Audience

We are going to communicate our findings to non-technical stakeholders, mostly to decision-makers.

# 4. Story

So first, let's find our story, and especially our narrative. There was an increase in the percentage of defaulting customers over the last 5 years. So the bank became interested in predicting which customers had a high probability of default. We analyzed the data and saw that people with more unemployment periods tend to default more. Also, our analysis showed that younger people with less income tend to default more. After training our model, we saw that it is possible to predict which people are more likely to default with an accuracy of 95%. To confirm these results, the next step should be to run a trial on a controlled population.

# 5. Tech or non-tech

We have our story. Now we need to translate technical results for non-technical stakeholders.

# 6. The right data

Let's define an audience persona. We report to the finance department director, who needs to decide on implementing an automated loan rejection system using our project findings. So we report the relationship between age or income and loan default and forecast percentage of customer defaulting over the next months.

# 7. Statistics

Because we need to summarize numerical data into an aggregate, we show the median age and income for default versus non default customers. Also, we need to show how the number of customer defaulting changes over time, so we show the percentage of change.

# 8. Visuals

Accordingly, we include a boxplot showing age or income vs. default condition,

and a lineplot with the percentage of change in defaulting customers over the next months.

# 10. Correct format

We now have all our pieces together. Let's recap. We are reporting to the Financial Department director, because she has an important decision ahead. She is interested in our key findings and recommendations, and we should communicate the findings through email before our meeting.

# 11. Report

All of these elements, lead us to select a written report to deliver our results. But should we select a summary or a final report?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/2f15e432-6534-4d83-ad1b-49dca59be460)

# 12. Report

It's a non-technical stakeholder, so a summary report should be better. Should it be an informational or an analytical report?

# 13. Report

We are presenting not only facts but also our analysis. So the most suitable is the analytical report.

# 14. Summary report structure

So how are structuring the summary report? Let's see. In the introduction, we first summarize the purpose of our report, we add contextual information about the reason of our project, and state our analysis question. Then, in the body, we are going to describe the data, and include only key findings in the result section. Lastly, we restate the questions linking it to the central insight and we add our recommendations.

# 15. Let's practice!

Now, it's your turn to organize summary reports for stakeholders!

Credit me
You are about to leave the office when you get a call from the operation director. She tells you that you need to write a report on the credit score to present to the advisory board. She explains: "They want to understand your analysis to help plan a strategy to pre-select customers for loans".

Which of the following reports is the most suitable to write in this case?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/e7d8ec40-4fcb-45ca-ac7d-c905b41aa5cd)

An analytic report showing relationships between different variables is a powerful tool for data-driven strategies.

# Report my credit

Your analytic report on the credit score project was a success. Your project manager was very satisfied with your work. Now, it's time to write the summary report for the financial department director. You want her to understand the key findings. Particularly, that the most important features for predicting a loan default are income, age, and employment length.

Can you put in order the sections of your summary report?

Order the report sections so that the first section should be on top and the last at the bottom.

You now understand the best practices to write a precise and reproducible report for each audience persona. Keep going and learn how to build a compelling oral presentation in Chapter 4.
