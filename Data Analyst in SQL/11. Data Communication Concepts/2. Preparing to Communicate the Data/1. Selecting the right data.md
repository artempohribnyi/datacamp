Deepen your storytelling knowledge. Learn how to avoid common mistakes when telling stories with data by tailoring your presentations to your audience. Then learn best practices for including visualizations and choosing between oral or written formats to make sure your presentations pack a punch!

# 1. Selecting the right data

Welcome back! We now understand the fundamentals of data storytelling.

# 2. Chapter 2

In this second chapter, we will deepen our knowledge by learning how to prepare for communicating data. We will learn how to identify the different targeted personas to appropriately select findings and statistics, visualizations, and choose the appropriate format to make an impact with our results.

# 3. Data storytelling road

Let's dive right in. We learned why designing a story is important. We also learned to decide between a technical or non-technical approach.

# 4. Data storytelling road

Now, it's time to select the right data.

# 5. The right data

But what does it mean to select the "right data"? It implies including sufficient contextual insights in our story to support our main point without overloading our report with information. In other words, we include the minimal amount of results that will support our story.

# 6. Data storytelling

And why is selecting insights important? Remember that data is one of the three central elements in any story. Garbage in, garbage out: if our raw data is bad and unreliable, then our analysis will be too. Same for our results But when we find the insights, we need to display our findings properly to highlight a different view of the data for each audience.

# 7. Stakeholders

Different stakeholders will be interested in our findings differently, so we need to tailor how we show our results to each of them. A stakeholder can be any person or group of persons that has an interest in the outcome of a project, or a decision or activity that is derived from it. As we mentioned before, stakeholders can be technical or non-technical. Among them, we may have different types of audiences.

# 8. Identifying personas

A helpful tool is to identify audience personas. It means describing the interests of the project outcomes and the technical knowledge of someone who represents our ideal target audience group. Defining personas helps selecting tailored findings to better convey our key insights.

# 9. Identifying personas

Let's go back to our communicatb food project. After finding our story, we need to define personas in our targeted audience, which will allow us to select the right findings in order to adjust our message.

# 10. Executive team

The first persona we might be reporting to is the executive team - most likely, the CEO, an investor, a director, or a founder. They have basic knowledge about technical aspects. And they usually need to inform their decisions using our project findings.

# 11. Project manager

In our example, when telling the story to our project manager, we can show the overall cost of the proposed next steps, and general metrics such as the predicted increase in number of customers, as well as the risk that our plan will fail.

# 12. Tech team

We can also present a report to our project collaborators or a technical supervisor with high technical knowledge. They are likely interested in replicating or continuing the project.

# 13. General audience

Lastly, we can show our story to an external customer or to other department staff that likely have basic or general technical knowledge, and want to understand the impact of the project.

# 14. General audience

In our example, we should show the historical decline in profits, and explain how the rebranding of the chocolate will increase next year earnings.

# 15. Audience skepticism

Finally, the audience can be more or less receptive to our results. Some will be more skeptical about our results than others. If people are easily convinced of our results, fine. But we should be prepared to bring in more data, insights and information to convince skeptics if our reasoning is put in doubt. A classic approach recommends to first convince yourself, then a friend then a skeptic.

# 16. Let's practice!

Now, it's your time to identify personas and tailor data given the situation at hand!

# The truth about salaries

Your predictive model for customer churn, which you worked on in Chapter 1, has been deployed. Your project manager asks you to work on a new internal project. The goal is to analyze a database with employee salaries in San Francisco, USA.

After doing an exhaustive exploratory data analysis, you have to present your findings to the human resources team. They want to compare San Francisco salary growth to the one at the company; they need to understand how to forecast salaries for the next year. You are about to copy the graphs from your analysis. Your manager reminds you to select the right data for your stakeholders.

You start by writing down what you believe can help you choose the proper findings.

One of the statements you wrote is false. Can you select which one it is?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/56e83cef-2bea-4463-8d31-814a01ba3e4b)

You should include only the data that is relevant for your specific audience. Too much information can be overwhelming and can cloud the understanding of the salary increase rate.

# Earning interests

Well done! Your presentation with the human resource department was a success. Your team lead asks you to show your data analysis results to different stakeholders. Before you dive into preparing the presentation or the report, you want to make sure that you are aligned with their interests.

With that goal in mind, you define several personas. It will help you select the suitable data later. You write down the personas, their knowledge, and their interest on this project.

Can you classify your notes into the following audience personas?

Correctly classify the following examples as Human Resources Director, technical supervisor, or marketing staff.

You can now identify personas and understand what insights are useful to each of them. This can help you select the appropriate findings to convey the appropriate message that aligns with each stakeholder's interests.
