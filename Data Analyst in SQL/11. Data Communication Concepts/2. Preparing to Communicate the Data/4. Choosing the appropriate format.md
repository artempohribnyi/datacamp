# 1. Choosing the appropriate format

We have just seen how to include visualizations in our story. Now, we'll learn when to use several presentation formats.

# 2. Data storytelling road

This is the final piece in our communication strategy. We've designed our story,

# 3. Data storytelling road

we've defined our approach,

# 4. Data storytelling road

we've selected the right data,

and we've chosen an impactful visualization.

# 6. Data storytelling road

Now, it's time to present it to our targeted audience.

# 7. Which format is more effective?

A good communication format shows key information from our project in a way that is engaging, and easy to understand.

# 8. Which format is more effective?

There are two main formats that we'll discuss here: written reports and oral presentations. Most data science projects will require a written report and an oral presentation, but in the end it depends on the situation and project at hand.

# 9. Presentation strategy

There are several things to consider when sharing findings: Our audience,

the content to include,

# 11. Presentation strategy

special requirements to take into account,

and which channel to use.

# 13. Presentation strategy

All these elements help us define the best format to communicate our results.

# 14. Stakeholders

The first thing to consider is who we are presenting to. This helps figure out Why they need to know about the findings: For accountability? To understand the methodology? How are they going to use our findings? To make a decision? To start a new project? What information do they need? Our results? The impact our findings have?

# 15. Content

The answer to these questions will help us decide which content to include. Should we focus on results, conclusions, include recommendations, or just explain the methods in detail?

# 16. Requirements

The next step is to identify whether any stakeholder has special requirements. Do they have enough time to read a detailed report, or is a short meeting better? Do they report to someone else, and need a document to back up a claim? Are they in a different timezone, so a written communication is preferred?

# 17. Consumption

We also need to think about how our presentation will be consumed. We could write a document such as a Word doc, a Jupyter notebook, a blog post or an article. We could also build a slide deck. Then, how will it be delivered? Will we present directly to stakeholders, being able to answer comments or questions, or will we share it by email or Slack and get questions later? Finally, how big would the audience be? You wouldn't present things the same way in a conference room of six people or a ballroom of two-hundred.

# 18. Oral communication

Selecting the correct format depends not only on the audience, but also on the strengths and weaknesses of the different formats. Oral communication allows for building a relationship with the audience, and for immediate feedback or actions. It delivers a rich message because body language and voice add meaning. However, unless you provide a recording, the message cannot be revised because there is no permanent record of communication, and it is not suitable for lengthy messages, as the longer the presentation is, the more chance there is that the audience will lose focus at some point.

# 19. Written communication

The written format provides records of communication so the message can be analyzed on the longer term. It is easy to share with large audiences, and it's less prone to emotional reactions. It is also suitable to share code with any technical stakeholder for review or replication. However, not seeing the audience reaction makes it harder to adapt, as the feedback is not immediate but will come later in the form of comments.

# 20. Appropriate format

Let's look at an example. We are presenting our findings to the communicatb company CEO. She is interested in our conclusions and wants quick answers to her questions. She's rather busy, but happens to be visiting our office at the end of the week. This is a perfect occasion to set up a quick meeting and deliver our findings using an oral presentation.

# 21. Appropriate format

After the meeting, the CEO tells us important decisions will be based on our conclusions and reported to investors. Now, it's time to structure them in a written report, taking into account the questions and feedback we got from her.

# 22. Let's practice!

Now, let's see if you can select the appropriate format given the situation at hand!

# A communication problem

Your coworker has been working on a project on price predictions. He asks you to help him choose the most suitable format to deliver his results to the executive board as well as to his team.

You give him a set of advice and rules of thumb, so he can make an informed decision. When you arrive home, you realize that you made one mistake.

Which of the following advice should you not have provided?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/5f7ab4d4-af16-418c-8659-2deeedf24546)

Your technical colleagues would be interested in understanding the methodology you used and the results you obtained. It will help them replicate your project.

# Should we meet?

It's Friday. Your project manager comes by your desk. She asks you about the status of your project on salaries for San Francisco employees. She tells you that you need to close the project. Fortunately, you have finished building the model.

But to close it, you need to communicate the results to the different stakeholders. After she talks with the people involved, you start to receive emails asking about the results. You need to decide if you are going to use an oral presentation or a written report.

Can you decide what type of format would be best suited depending on the situation and requirements?

Correctly classify the following inquiries as suitable for an oral or written format.

Identifying the appropriate format is a key point in any communication strategy. Choosing the most suitable way to deliver your results can help your analysis have a bigger impact!

# When in doubt

You manage to deliver the results to almost all the stakeholders. You are about to start writing the report for the founder when you get an email. Your founder is coming by the office the following Friday. Your manager wants to know if presenting the project during a meeting would be better.

You have second thoughts about changing the format. So you decide to write down beneficial and unfavorable aspects of an oral presentation.

Can you classify your thoughts correctly?

Correctly classify examples where an oral presentation is either beneficial or a unfavorable.

You should meet with the founder and follow up with a report you previously wrote for another stakeholder. Keep going and learn more about how to write reports in Chapter 3.
