# 1. Building presentation slides

In the previous video, we've seen how planning is paramount before actually building slides.

# 2. From planning to building

Now, we should design the slides. There are some suggestions we can follow. Our slides should support the story we are conveying. When building the slides, we should keep in mind our audience attention capacities. It's better to have many slides with little content on each, making for a more dynamic presentation, rather than few slides with lots of content.

# 3. From planning to building

There's a good reason for counting slides: the idea is to prevent presenters from going over time. But we shouldn't worry about counting slides or how much time we spend on each. Instead,

# 4. From planning to building

we should have one message per slide. It will keep things short and fluid. Our audience can only absorb a certain amount of information at once. Trying to cover too much information simultaneously will increase the cognitive load, cloud our message, and cause our audience to miss some of the key points.

# 5. Color

Formatting can emphasize, or on the contrary cloud, the message we want to convey. One formatting technique is color. Remember, everything you present should convey meaning, and everything else should be cut. So as far as colors are concerned, we use the least amount of colors needed to convey our message. Also, we should maintain a good contrast between your text and background, to help readability.

# 6. Color

We also need to be attentive to potentially impaired auditors. People who have color-vision deficiency can't distinguish between two different colors, so those people will struggle to understand the text or graph on the slides if you use green and red together.

# 7. Fonts

Fonts also impact readability. The research is inconclusive on which typeface is easier to read between serif and sans-serif. The rule of thumb would be sans serif is appropriate for text that will be read on a screen, and serif is appropriate for text that will be printed. The font choice is also contextual: Comic Sans Ms gets a bad rep, but it's a great font if presenting to kids. Not so much in a business setting. In the end, the slide content is there to support what we're saying. And usually, texts are hard to read not because of the font choice, but because they are long texts in a small size. Let's keep our texts short and big instead.

# 8. Fonts

We can also use several fonts, change the spacing of letters and lines, as well as use bold, italic and various font sizes. We should use as little of these to get our message across without distracting from it.

# 9. Text slide

Including too much text can have a negative impact. The audience tends to read the slide instead of listening.

# 10. Text slide

Instead we should write the main points supporting our message. The slides are just a support. They are not built to be consumed without a presenter: if they need to be, then a recording can do the trick - but we shouldn't dual purpose our slides into written reports.

# 11. Text slide

Including a slide headline helps persuade the audience to pay attention at that particular moment of the presentation. The headline should highlight the main point of the slide, be concise and specific, and be visible thanks to a bigger font.

# 12. Text slide

Layering is a powerful tool which breaks a complex slide into smaller points. The idea is to have a cleaner, better structured slide making it easier to focus on each part individually.

# 13. Text slide

Each point is presented and explained on its own,

before being displayed together to wrap up the message. This approach helps focus our audience's attention.

# 15. Visualization slide

When we find ourselves using too much text, we should think about replacing it with a graph. People usually understand visual information much better.

# 16. Visualization slide

Layering and highlighting also work pretty well: we can display each graph one by one, and put them together to summarize the idea. Highlighting the graph or part of the graph can also help us direct our audience to what we are explaining. It also works for text, to highlight an idea or a metric.

# 17. Visualization slide

If needed, headlines should also be used following the same guidelines that we saw for text slides.

# 18. Visualization slide

Finally, we should use only one or two full-size graphs per slide, preventing us from conveying more than one message per slide, and prevent us from overcrowding slides.

# 19. Let's practice!

In a nutshell, we want to deliver our message while keeping things as simple as possible, and limiting the cognitive load of the audience as much as possible. All right, let's practice!

# A color building

You have planned the presentation for your findings on software development sector salaries for San Francisco employees. Now, it's time to build the slides. After putting your slide deck together, you ask your coworker to give you feedback. She makes comments on the different slides.

You start by reviewing the following graph slide.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/44a766c4-cb96-4bc3-86fa-b8a7d2ef2774)

One of the comments she wrote about the slide is not correct. Can you select which one it is?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/ed2064cf-4cf9-40ed-b73b-a3a9b4df55fc)

When choosing a font, you should consider their typesetting, as well as the spacing of letters and lines. They all affect readability. And you should choose a font that is easy to read.

# Too much text

Your coworker also gives you feedback on slides that only have text. She feels like the slide can be improved a lot. She gives you some options on how you can improve the slide.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/c3ee94fb-dbe2-46c5-b391-3bb296b4cb2b)

One of the following statements is not correct. Can you select which one is it?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/846e117c-f124-4a3f-85f4-c71100588490)

You should avoid using more than three colors in a slide as it can result in distraction. Also, you should be aware of color-blind people and avoid using red and green.

# The right building

Well done building a text slide! Now, you need to review the rest of the comments from your coworker. She left you the feedback in two stacks of notes: one stack for best practices and one stack for what you should avoid. However, the stacks fell during your lunch break and are all mixed up.

Can you classify which of the following comments are best practice in building a presentation, and which ones should be avoided?

Correctly classify the comments as either best practices or practices to avoid.

Designing slides efficiently is paramount when communicating your findings. A good story with a bad presentation can result in the message not being effectively received, and acted upon. Now, you're aware of the best practices when building slides. Keep learning and find out how to deliver your presentation!
