Let's start with the importance of data storytelling and the elements you need to tell stories with data. You'll learn best practices to influence how decisions are made before learning how to translate technical results into stories for non-technical stakeholders.

# 1. Fundamentals of storytelling

Welcome! My name is Hadrien and I will be your guide for this course.

# 2. Challenger

Before we jump in, let me tell you a story. In 1986, the Challenger shuttle's fuel tank ignited and the shuttle crashed, killing the seven astronauts on board.

# 3. Good warning, bad delivery

The culprits were two redundant seals in a joint that broke. NASA employees warned that flying was unsafe in the following slide (in the circled part), but the message didn't go through. This is an extreme example, but it shows how crucial results can fail to have an impact (or have a bad one) because of bad communication.

# 4. About the course

Throughout the course, we will learn how to communicate results to different stakeholders using storytelling. We will also cover how to structure a report and build an oral presentation.

# 5. Chapter 1

We'll translate technical results for non-technical stakeholders, and we'll see how to structure stories to impact the decision making process. And let's be clear right away: data storytelling is not about spinning results, it's about making them stick. For this to work, they should be simple (pruning the message to its core), concrete (can be described or detected by human senses), and credible (can be put to test).

# 6. Data storytelling road

In any communication strategy, there are several pieces we have to put together to create an effective story.

# 7. Why are stories needed?

But why are stories needed in the first place? People working with data spend a lot of time collecting and processing data, and modeling and evaluating results.

# 8. Why are stories needed?

But what about communicating insights? Even the best results could fail to have an impact if the insights are not presented appropriately. One of the main challenges is to convince change-adverse stakeholders that some things should be done differently, especially if these stakeholders are non-technical, and do not feel comfortable with math or statistics.

# 9. What is data storytelling?

That's why telling stories with data is paramount. So what's data storytelling? It's a powerful mechanism for sharing insights supported by a compelling narrative and efficient visualizations. Why is it so powerful? Anecdotes drive people's imagination and stories are more memorable than metrics, and they add value by giving context to the data. Thanks to that, the audience can understand the insights. So their attention is captured. Those insights facilitate the decision-making process and in turn, drive actions and changes.

# 10. Data storytelling

Let's start with building an effective data story. Two concepts help us build its core. The first concept, the three-minute story, makes us think: if we only had three minutes to tell a story, what would we focus on? The second concept, the big idea, pushes us to state our story's unique point of view in one sentence. These concepts help us articulate our story clearly and concisely.

# 11. Data storytelling

There are three central elements for any data story: the data, the narrative and the visuals. These elements make the story insightful, as it derives clear learnings from our analysis, explanatory, because we help our audience understand the insights, and concise, giving only concrete and specific facts.

# 12. Data

To build an effective story, we should include only findings from our models or analysis that apply to the situation. Our story should be based on accurate and reliable data, leaving out all untrustworthy results. More importantly, our story should always include actionable insights: data that drives action.

# 13. Narrative

A good data story includes a compelling and easy to understand narrative that includes only the key points needed to drive change.

# 14. Narrative

Even though it is tempting to include many disconnected facts, a compelling narrative revolves around one central insight, that takes into account the background and our intended audience so it can clarify the facts for them. Who are they? What do they need to know? Lastly, every data story follows a linear sequence. So every data point builds on each other until the conclusion is reached.

# 15. Visuals

However, we should be careful not to include misleading graphs.

# 16. Fictional company

We are going to look at how all the concepts are implemented at a fictional data science consulting company named communicatb.

# 17. Let's practice!

Let's put these concepts into practice!

# The story begins

You recently started working as a data scientist at a company named Communicatb. For your first project, you and your team need to analyze customer churn data for a cell phone company. The goal is to predict their behavior and help develop a program to retain customers.

Your team lead knows you are an expert on storytelling. She asks you to explain to the team why crafting a compelling story is important when delivering results. You write down a list of reasons to be prepared.

One of the statements you wrote is false. Can you select which one is it?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/6b184f91-c81f-4e5e-bd74-1f57ada2375c)

Data is the foundation of your story. So you need to make sure you are telling a story based on reliable and accurate results!

# Building a story

You nailed it! Your explanation of why stories are efficient when conveying insights went very well! Now, your team lead would like you to give a short presentation. You're going to explain the different steps involved in telling a story with data to the team. It will be the starting point for delivering the results of the churn project when it's ready.

You know it is an important task. To prepare for your talk, you look for your notes on the storytelling course you took, but realize that some parts are erased. So you need to remember the do's and dont's of data storytelling.

Which of the following statements about effective data storytelling are true, and which are false?

Correctly classify the statements as either true or false.

You can now identify the elements that make a good data story. Relevant and reliable data as well as a compelling narrative are central to storytelling. Keep going and learn how to translate technical results for non-technical stakeholders.
