# 1. Impacting the decision-making process

Well done! We've discussed data storytelling and translating results for non-technical stakeholders.

# 2. Data storytelling

Particularly, we mentioned that a strong data story has three elements: the data, the narrative, and the visuals.

# 3. Compelling narrative

Let's focus on the narrative. After we've found relevant insights in our data, we have to find a meaningful way to present them to our target audience, using a narrative that includes only key points and helps us drive change. In other words, we need a compelling narrative or a description of connected events that organizes information to engage the audience and make them care for the results or information shared.

# 4. Narrative structure

This might sound challenging at first, but following a narrative structure will help. There are several narrative structures that are out of the scope of this course, but it all comes down to a structural framework guiding how we present our story. Imagine that as part of the job at communicatb, we are presenting results to a food company. To start our data story, we should mention the background: details about what problem motivated the analysis, what changed in the previous situation that warranted an analysis, and who the analysis is focusing on. Are we analyzing data from customers? From employees? Or something else?. In our case, we mention that opposite to management expectations the company's total profits have decreased in the last three quarters.

# 5. Narrative structure

After the problem was introduced, we should provide evidence of the factors that contributed to the problem. But we should only include relevant information and not detailed data that can overload the audience. We analyzed the data and found that the chips sales have increased by 20%. However, sweet item sales have declined overall by 30%.

# 6. Narrative structure

We can also provide more supporting evidence and data, as long as it helps explain on a deeper level the cause of the problem. So after taking a deeper look, we saw that the company's most popular chocolate has seen its sales decreased by 50%.

# 7. Narrative structure

All the evidence should lead to the climax: the moment when we introduce the central finding of our analysis. It should state clearly what could happen if nothing changes. We predicted that if the company does not make a decision, it will lose 10 million dollars next year.

# 8. Narrative structure

After the main finding is revealed, we should finish exploring potential solutions and opportunities, by recommending a course of action to take. We need to be proactive and guide the audience through understanding what to do with our results if we want to impact the decision making process. So according to our predictions, rebranding the chocolate and offering special discounts can achieve a 20% profit. With these steps, we created a narrative that will catch our audience's interest, and is easy to follow.

# 9. Building narrative

Running an analysis, there are several things you might look at, which will in turn drive our narrative. We can explore how a feature changes over time or the time cycle patterns, for example, how chocolate sales are lower in summer but higher in winter. we could focus on how two things are related to each other, for example chocolate price and the customer rating, or display similarities and differences between chocolate consumption between adults and children. Also, we can find groups in the data, such as high chocolate and high coffee consumers vs low chocolate and low coffee consumers. As we craft our narrative, we need to make sure that these data points make a relevant and relatable story.

# 10. Let's practice!

OK, now we understand more about narrative structure, let's put these concepts into practice.

# Is it a true story?

You have done an amazing job explaining your exploratory data analysis on the churn project. Now, it's time to run the model to predict customer churn. You know that you will have to craft an effective story to present these results.

You want to be prepared. So you read your notes on how to build a compelling narrative. But you realized that one of your notes is not accurate.

Which of the following statements is false?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/23f95357-c809-4001-9d08-8ddb893b8e2e)

A strong compelling narrative is key when telling stories with data. It can make a difference in the decision-making process. But remember that the story should always be based on strong and trustworthy results.

# Structured to impact

Your project on customer churn is done. You analyzed the data and built your model. You followed the steps for storytelling. Now, it's time to structure your story to have an impact at the decision-making level. You want stakeholders to follow your recommendations.

You like to write things down. So you take a pen and paper, and write down the different things you want to say in order on sticky notes. The window suddenly opens, throwing all of your notes on the floor.

Can you organize the steps for telling a story with data that is solid enough to influence the decision-makers?

Order the steps chronologically: the first step should be on top and the last step at the bottom.

You have organized a strong compelling narrative for your story! This makes it easier to understand and can help to persuade stakeholders to take actions and drive change!

# A story to compare

Great job organizing your narrative structure! The next step is to think about how you will present your insights.

You start reading and discover there are several ways to present data stories. You can compare your data, show correlation, cluster your dataâ€¦

You are curious to know what type of data story would be a good fit for your data. You write down the central finding, your insights and the supporting evidence.

Can you classify your findings into the following categories?

Correctly classify the following examples as comparison, correlation or clustering.

You have reached the end of Chapter 1. You've now mastered the basics of storytelling. In the next chapters, you will build on this foundation to prepare the data to write a report or build an oral presentation.
