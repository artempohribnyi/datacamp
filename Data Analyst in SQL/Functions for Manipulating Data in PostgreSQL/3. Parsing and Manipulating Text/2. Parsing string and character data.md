# 1. Parsing string and character data

Next up we will learn about string functions in PostgreSQL that allow us to parse and manipulate text data. We will also learn how to combine and nest functions to provide additional capabilities.

# 2. Determining the length of a string

First, let's look at the CHAR_LENGTH function. The CHAR_LENGTH function can be used to determine the number of characters in a string. CHAR_LENGTH accepts a string as an input and returns the number of characters in the string as an integer for the output. In this example, we see the CHAR_LENGTH function used on the title column of the film table in the DVD Rental database.

# 3. Determining the length of a string

LENGTH is analogous to CHAR_LENGTH, accepts the same parameter and returns the same result as you can see in this example. These two functions can be used interchangeably depending on your preference.

# 4. Finding the position of a character in a string

The POSITION function returns an integer which represents the number of characters from left to right before the search string is located. Looking at the customer table we can find the position of the at sign in the email column.

# 5. Finding the position of a character in a string

STRPOS is analogous to POSITION with a slightly different syntax as you see in this example.

# 6. Parsing string data

Now let's look at some functions that will help you parse strings into substrings. The LEFT function allows you to extract the first "n" characters of a string. In this example, we are going to extract the first fifty characters of the description column from the film table in our DVD Rental database.

# 7. Parsing string data

The RIGHT function is very similar to LEFT but as you might expect it extracts the last "n" characters of a string.

# 8. Extracting substrings of character data

SUBSTRING allows us to do pretty much exactly what its name implies - extract a substring from text data. The substring functions takes 3 parameters. The first is the source string or column, in this example the description column from the film table. This is followed by an integer representing the starting position of the source string or in this case the number 10. Finally, we include another integer to specify the length of the substring that we want to extract. In this case, the number 50.

# 9. Extracting substrings of character data

SUBSTRING can be combined with other functions to provide additional capabilities. In this example, we can extract the text from the left side of the at sign in an email address using a slightly different set of parameters in the SUBSTRING function. The first parameter remains the same, but the second parameter is replaced with the FROM keyword followed by an integer representing the starting position and the third parameter includes the FOR keyword followed by an integer representing the ending position. In this example we use the POSITION function as the second parameter in the SUBSTRING function.

# 10. Extracting substrings of character data

Now we can use a different technique if we want to extract the characters to the right of the at sign in the email column. In this example, we use the POSITION function as the second parameter of SUBSTRING to determine the starting position in the string and the CHAR_LENGTH to determine the last position which is a nice trick for determining the last position of a string. The POSITION function will return the integer value of the position of the at sign in the string. To exclude the at sign from the result, we need to add one to the starting position.

# 11. Extracting substrings of character data

SUBSTR is analogous to SUBSTRING but only allows for the parameters to be separated by commas and does not allow for the alternative syntax with the FROM and FOR keywords.

# 12. Let's practice!

Now it's your turn! Let's practice using these functions in the exercises.

# Determining the length of strings

Determining the number of characters in a string is something that you will use frequently when working with data in a SQL database. Many situations will require you to find the length of a string stored in your database. For example, you may need to limit the number of characters that are displayed in an application or you may need to ensure that a column in your dataset contains values that are all the same length. In this example, we are going to determine the length of the description column in the film table of the DVD Rental database.

```
SELECT 
  -- Select the title and description columns
  title,
  description,
  -- Determine the length of the description column
  LENGTH(description) AS desc_len
FROM film;
```

# Truncating strings

In the previous exercise, you calculated the length of the description column and noticed that the number of characters varied but most of the results were over 75 characters. There will be many times when you need to truncate a text column to a certain length to meet specific criteria for an application. In this exercise, we will practice getting the first 50 characters of the description column.

```
