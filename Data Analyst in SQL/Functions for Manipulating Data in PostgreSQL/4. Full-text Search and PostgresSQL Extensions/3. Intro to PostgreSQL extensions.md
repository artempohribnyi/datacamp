# 1. Intro to PostreSQL extensions

You've learned how basic full text search is a better option when searching text data for a string. Next we're going to learn about some common extensions, fuzzystrmatch and pg_trgm, that enhance the full text search capabilities of PostgreSQL.

# 2. Intro to PostgreSQL extensions

But first we will learn about the PostgreSQL extension framework in more detail. Most PostgreSQL distributions come bundled with a common set of widely used and supported extensions from the community that can be used by simply enabling them. Here are a few common extensions: PostGIS adds support for allowing location queries to be run in SQL. PostPic allows for image processing within the database. fuzzystrmatch and pg_trgm provide functions that extend full text search capabilities by finding similarities between strings.

# 3. Querying extension meta data

To help you discover what extensions are available in your specific PostgreSQL distribution, you can query the pg_available_extensions system view, as shown in this example, to determine a list of extensions that are available to be installed and enabled for use. The results return the name of the first two available extensions. A similar query of the pg_extension system table will tell you which extensions have already been enabled in your database and are currently available for your use. Here we see only one result, the extension plpgsql.

# 4. Loading extensions into your database

Any of the extensions that are returned from the pg_available_extensions system view can be loaded into your database and enabled with a simple query using the CREATE EXTENSION command, an example of which is shown here. The IF NOT EXISTS commands can be used to ensure that if the extension has previously been enabled, the query will not generate an error message. Now if we query the pg_extension table again by selecting the extname column for all records, we should see that fuzzystrmatch is now listed with plpgsql.

# 5. Using fuzzystrmatch or fuzzy searching

When preforming a full text search based on user input or looking to perform an analysis and comparison of text data in a natural language processing exercise, a function that you will use often is levenshtein from the fuzzystrmatch extension. The levenshtein function calculates the levenshtein distance between two strings which is the number of edits required for the strings to be a perfect match. In this example, you see the distance returned is 2 because in order to convert GUMBO to GAMBOL it would require replacing the U with an A and adding an L to the end of the word or two edits.

# 6. Compare two strings with pg_trgm

The pg_trgm extension provides functions and operators to determine the similarity of two strings using trigram matchings. Trigrams are groups of 3 consecutive characters in a string and based on the number of matching trigrams in two strings will provide a measurement of how similar they are. This measurement can be calculated using the similarity function of this extension. The similarity function accepts two parameters; the first being the string you wish to compare and the second being the string you wish to compare against. This function will return a number between 0-1 with zero representing no matching trigrams at all and 1 representing a perfect match. In this example we see that using similarity on GUMBO and GAMBOL returns a value of 0.181818.

# 7. Let's practice!

Great job! Let's practice

# Enabling extensions

Before you can use the capabilities of an extension it must be enabled. As you have previously learned, most PostgreSQL distributions come pre-bundled with many useful extensions to help extend the native features of your database. You will be working with fuzzystrmatch and pg_trgm in upcoming exercises but before you can practice using the capabilities of these extensions you will need to first make sure they are enabled in our database. In this exercise you will enable the pg_trgm extension and confirm that the fuzzystrmatch extension, which was enabled in the video, is still enabled by querying the pg_extension system table.

```
-- Enable the pg_trgm extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
```
Now confirm that both fuzzystrmatch and pg_trgm are enabled by selecting all rows from the appropriate system table.

```
-- Select all rows extensions
SELECT *
FROM pg_extension;
```

# Measuring similarity between two strings

Now that you have enabled the fuzzystrmatch and pg_trgm extensions you can begin to explore their capabilities. First, we will measure the similarity between the title and description from the film table of the Sakila database.

```
-- Select the title and description columns
SELECT 
  title, 
  description, 
  -- Calculate the similarity
  SIMILARITY(title, description)
FROM 
  film
```

# Levenshtein distance examples

Now let's take a closer look at how we can use the levenshtein function to match strings against text data. If you recall, the levenshtein distance represents the number of edits required to convert one string to another string being compared.

In a search application or when performing data analysis on any data that contains manual user input, you will always want to account for typos or incorrect spellings. The levenshtein function provides a great method for performing this task. In this exercise, we will perform a query against the film table using a search string with a misspelling and use the results from levenshtein to determine a match. Let's check it out.

```
-- Select the title and description columns
SELECT  
  title, 
  description, 
  -- Calculate the levenshtein distance
  LEVENSHTEIN(title, 'JET NEIGHBOR') AS distance
FROM 
  film
ORDER BY 3;
```

# Putting it all together

In this exercise, we are going to use many of the techniques and concepts we learned throughout the course to generate a data set that we could use to predict whether the words and phrases used to describe a film have an impact on the number of rentals.

First, you need to create a tsvector from the description column in the film table. You will match against a tsquery to determine if the phrase "Astounding Drama" leads to more rentals per month. Next, create a new column using the similarity function to rank the film descriptions based on this phrase.

```

```
