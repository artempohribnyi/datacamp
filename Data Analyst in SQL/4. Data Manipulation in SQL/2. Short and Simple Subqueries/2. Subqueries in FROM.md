# 1. Subqueries in the FROM statement

Fantastic! You're really getting the hang of using subqueries. In this lesson, we will cover the use of subqueries in your FROM statement.

# 2. Subqueries in FROM

You probably noticed that subqueries in WHERE can only return a single column. But what if you want to return a more complex set of results? Subqueries in the FROM statement are a robust tool for restructuring and transforming your data. Often, the data you need to answer a question is not yet in the format necessary to query it directly, and requires some additional processing to prepare for analysis. For example, you may want to transform your data into a different shape, or pre-filter it before making calculations. Subqueries in a FROM statement are a common way of preparing that data. Subqueries in FROM are also useful when calculating aggregates of aggregate information. Let's say you're interested in getting the top 3 teams who scored the highest number of home_goals on average in the 2011/2012 season. You would first calculate the average for each team in the league, and THEN calculate the max value for any team overall. This can be easily accomplished with a subquery in FROM.

# 3. FROM subqueries...

Let's examine the home_goal average for every team in the database. First, you will create the query that will become your subquery. This query here selects the team's long name from the "team" table, and the AVG of home_goal column from the "match" table. The team table is left joined onto the "match" table using hometeam_id, which will give you the identity of the home team. The query is then filtered by season and grouped by team. The results look like this -- an average value calculated for each team in the table.

# 4. ...to main queries!

In order to get only the top team as a final result, place this ENTIRE query without the semicolon inside the FROM statement of an outer query,

# 5. ...to main queries!

...make sure to give it an alias...

# 6. ...to main queries!

...then add it to the main query, selecting the team, and home_avg columns from the subquery, just as you would with any other table in the database.

# 7. ...to main queries!

Finally, don't forget to order by home_avg, descending, and limit the query to 3 results. The final query returns your top 3 teams based on home_goals scored in the 2011/2012 season. And it seems our top team for that season is Barcelona!

# 8. Things to remember

There are a few key things to remember when using subqueries in the FROM statement. The first, is that you have the ability to create more than one subquery in the FROM statement of any main query. When you do so, make sure that you give each subquery an alias, and make sure that you are able to JOIN them to each other, just as you would when querying a table from your database. Second, you can join a subquery to any existing table in your database. Again, however, you need to make sure you have a column in the subquery that you can use with the JOIN you'd like to perform.

# 9. Let's practice!

Fantastic! It's time for you to practice using subqueries in the FROM clause.

# Joining Subqueries in FROM

The match table in the European Soccer Database does not contain country or team names. You can get this information by joining it to the country table, and use this to aggregate information, such as the number of matches played in each country.

If you're interested in filtering data from one of these tables, you can also create a subquery from one of the tables, and then join it to an existing table in the database. A subquery in FROM is an effective way of answering detailed questions that requires filtering or transforming data before including it in your final results.

Your goal in this exercise is to generate a subquery using the match table, and then join that subquery to the country table to calculate information about matches with 10 or more goals in total!

1. Create the subquery to be used in the next step, which selects the country ID and match ID (id) from the match table.
Filter the query for matches with greater than or equal to 10 goals.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the country ID and match ID
	id, 
    country_id 
FROM match
-- Filter for matches with 10 or more goals in total
WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10;
```

2. Construct a subquery that selects only matches with 10 or more total goals.
Inner join the subquery onto country in the main query.
Select name from country and count the id column from match.

```
SELECT
	-- Select country name and the count match IDs
    c.name AS country_name,
    COUNT(sub.id) AS matches
FROM country AS c
-- Inner join the subquery onto country
-- Select the country id and match id columns
INNER JOIN (SELECT country_id, id
           FROM match
           -- Filter the subquery by matches with 10+ goals
           WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10) AS sub
ON c.id = sub.country_id
GROUP BY country_name;
```

You generated a count of matches in each country where the total goals was higher than 10. That's a lot of goals!

# Building on Subqueries in FROM

In the previous exercise, you found that England, Netherlands, Germany and Spain were the only countries that had matches in the database where 10 or more goals were scored overall. Let's find out some more details about those matches -- when they were played, during which seasons, and how many of the goals were home versus away goals.

You'll notice that in this exercise, the table alias is excluded for every column selected in the main query. This is because the main query is extracting data from the subquery, which is treated as a single table.

Complete the subquery inside the FROM clause. Select the country name from the country table, along with the date, the home goal, the away goal, and the total goals columns from the match table.
Create a column in the subquery that adds home and away goals, called total_goals. This will be used to filter the main query.
Select the country, date, home goals, and away goals in the main query.
Filter the main query for games with 10 or more total goals.

'''
SELECT
	-- Select country, date, home, and away goals from the subquery
    country,
    date,
    home_goal,
    away_goal
FROM 
	-- Select country name, date, home_goal, away_goal, and total goals in the subquery
	(SELECT name AS country, 
     	    m.date, 
     		m.home_goal, 
     		m.away_goal,
           (m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS total_goals
    FROM match AS m
    LEFT JOIN country AS c
    ON m.country_id = c.id) AS subq
-- Filter by total goals scored in the main query
WHERE total_goals >= 10;
'''

You can manipulate the information you extract by placing joins in or using a subquery. These must have been exciting matches!
