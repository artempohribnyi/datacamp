# 1. Subqueries in SELECT

So far, we've covered the use of simple subqueries in FROM and WHERE statements. Subqueries can also be included in a SELECT statement to bring summary values into a detailed data set.

# 2. SELECTing what?

Subqueries in SELECT are used to return a single, aggregate value. This can be fairly useful, since, as you'll recall, you cannot include an aggregate value in an ungrouped SQL query. Subqueries in SELECT are one way to get around that. Subqieries in SELECT are also useful when performing complex mathematical calculations on information in your data set. For example, you may want to see how much an individual score deviates from an average -- say, how higher than the average is this individual score?

# 3. Subqueries in SELECT

Including a subquery in SELECT is fairly simple, and is set up the same way you set up subqueries in the WHERE and FROM clauses. Let's say we want to create a column to compare the total number of matches played in each season to the total number of matches played OVERALL. We can first calculate the overall count of matches across all seasons, which is 12,837.

# 4. Subqueries in SELECT

We can then add that single number to the SELECT statement, which yields the following results...

# 5. Subqueries in SELECT

...or, we can skip that step, and add the subquery directly to the SELECT statement to get identical results.

# 6. SELECT subqueries for mathematical calculations

Subqueries in SELECT are also incredibly useful for calculations with the data you are querying. The single value returned by a subquery in select can be used to calculate information based on existing information in a database. For example, the overall average number of goals scored in a match across all seasons is 2.72. If you want to calculate the difference from the average in any given match, you can either calculate this number ahead of time in a separate query, and input the value into the SELECT statement...

# 7. Subqueries in SELECT

...or you can use a subquery that calculates this value for you in your SELECT statement, and subtract it from the total goals in that match. Overall, this second option can save you a lot of time and errors in your work, and the results you see here, are identical to calculating the result manually.

# 8. SELECT subqueries -- things to keep in mind

There are a few unique considerations when working with subqueries in SELECT. The first is that the subquery needs to return a single value. If your subquery result returns multiple rows, your entire query will generate an error. This is because the information retrieved in a SELECT query is applied identically to each row in the data set -- and that's not possible if there's more than one unit of information. The second thing to keep an eye out is the correct placement of your data's filters in both the main query and the subquery. Here is the query from the previous slide. Since the subquery is processed before the main query, you'll need to include relevant filters in the subquery as well as the main query. Without the WHERE clause you see here in the subquery, the number returned would have been the overall average across all seasons rather than in the 2011/2012 season.

# 9. Let's practice!

Okay! Let's practice a few examples of subqueries in the SELECT statement.

# Add a subquery to the SELECT clause

Subqueries in SELECT statements generate a single value that allow you to pass an aggregate value down a data frame. This is useful for performing calculations on data within your database.

In the following exercise, you will construct a query that calculates the average number of goals per match in each country's league.

In the subquery, select the average total goals by adding home_goal and away_goal.
Filter the results so that only the average of goals in the 2013/2014 season is calculated.
In the main query, select the average total goals by adding home_goal and away_goal. This calculates the average goals for each league.
Filter the results in the main query the same way you filtered the subquery. Group the query by the league name.

```
SELECT 
	l.name AS league,
    -- Select and round the league's total goals
    ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal), 2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Select & round the average total goals for the season
    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(home_goal + away_goal), 2) 
     FROM match
     WHERE season = '2013/2014') AS overall_avg
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
-- Filter for the 2013/2014 season
WHERE season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY league;
```

With a subquery in select, you can compare each league's average to the overall average. Which leagues tend to score higher than average?

# Subqueries in Select for Calculations

Subqueries in SELECT are a useful way to create calculated columns in a query. A subquery in SELECT can be treated as a single numeric value to use in your calculations. When writing queries in SELECT, it's important to remember that filtering the main query does not filter the subquery -- and vice versa.

In the previous exercise, you created a column to compare each league's average total goals to the overall average goals in the 2013/2014 season. In this exercise, you will add a column that directly compares these values by subtracting the overall average from the subquery.

Select the average goals scored in a match for each league in the main query.
Select the average goals scored in a match overall for the 2013/2014 season in the subquery.
Subtract the subquery from the average number of goals calculated for each league.
Filter the main query so that only games from the 2013/2014 season are included.

```
SELECT
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
	ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal),2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Subtract the overall average from the league average
	ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) - 
		(SELECT AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
		 FROM match 
         WHERE season = '2013/2014'),2) AS diff
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
-- Only include 2013/2014 results
WHERE season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY l.name;
```

Games in the Netherlands tend to score the highest number of goals on average in this season. Why do you think that is?
