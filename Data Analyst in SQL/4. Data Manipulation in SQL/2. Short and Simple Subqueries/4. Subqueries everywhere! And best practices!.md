# 1. Subqueries everywhere! And best practices!

Now that you've covered the ways in which you can use subqueries in the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses, let's look at the use of multiple subqueries in one query, and some best practices for making sure your queries are as readable as possible.

# 2. As many subqueries as you want...

In SQL, you can include as many simple subqueries as you need within multiple clauses within your query. However, your queries can quickly become long, and difficult to read. For example, the query you see here includes a subquery in the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE statements. You don't have to read through this now, but it's worth getting a sense of how extensive SQL queries can get, and discuss some best practices for reading, and writing large queries.

# 3. Format your queries

The best practice you can start early on in your SQL journey is properly formatting your queries. It's important to properly line up your SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, and WHERE statements, and all of the information contained in them. This way, you and others you work with can return to a saved query and easily tell if these statements are part of a main query, or a subquery.

# 4. Annotate your queries

It's also considered best practice to annotate your queries with comments in order to tell the user what it does -- using either a multiple line comment, inside a forward slash, star, and ending with a star, and a forward slash.

# 5. Annotate your queries

You can also use in-line comments using two dashes. Every piece of information after an in-line comment is treated as text, even if it's a recognized SQL command.

# 6. Indent your queries

Additionally, make sure that you properly indent all information contained within a subquery. That way, you can easily return to the query and understand what information is being processed first, where you need to apply changes, such as to a range of dates, and what you can expect from your results if you make those changes.

# 7. Indent your queries

Make sure that you clearly indent all information that's part of a single column, such as a long CASE statement, or a complicated subquery in SELECT. In order to best keep track of all the conditions necessary to set up each WHEN clause, each THEN clause, and how they create the column outcome, it's important to clearly indent each piece of information in the statement. Overall, I highly recommend you read Holywell's SQL Style Guide to get a sense of all the formatting conventions when working with SQL queries.

# 8. Is that subquery necessary?

When deciding whether or not you need a subquery, it's important to know that each subquery you add requires additional computing power to generate your results. Depending on the size of your database and the number of records you extract in your query, you may significantly increase the amount of time it takes to run your query. So it's always worth asking whether or not a specific subquery is necessary to get the results you need.

# 9. Properly filter each subquery!

Finally, when constructing a main query with multiple subquery, make sure that your filters are properly placed in every subquery, and the main query, in order to generate accurate results. The query here, for example, filters for the 2013/2014 season in 3 places -- once in the SELECT subquery, once in the WHERE subquery, and once in the main query. This ensures that all data returned is only about matches from the 2013/2014 season.

# 10. Let's practice!

Okay! Time to practice creating complex queries with multiple subqueries.

# ALL the subqueries EVERYWHERE

In soccer leagues, games are played at different stages. Winning teams progress from one stage to the next, until they reach the final stage. In each stage, the stakes become higher than the previous one. The match table includes data about the different stages that each match took place in.

In this lesson, you will build a final query across 3 exercises that will contain three subqueries -- one in the SELECT clause, one in the FROM clause, and one in the WHERE clause. In the final exercise, your query will extract data examining the average goals scored in each stage of a match. Does the average number of goals scored change as the stakes get higher from one stage to the next?

Extract the average number of home and away team goals in two SELECT subqueries.
Calculate the average home and away goals for the specific stage in the main query.
Filter both subqueries and the main query so that only data from the 2012/2013 season is included.
Group the query by the m.stage column.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the stage and average goals for each stage
	m.stage,
    ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal),2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Select the average overall goals for the 2012/2013 season
    ROUND((SELECT AVG(home_goal + away_goal) 
           FROM match 
           WHERE season = '2012/2013'),2) AS overall
FROM match AS m
-- Filter for the 2012/2013 season
WHERE season = '2012/2013'
-- Group by stage
GROUP BY m.stage;
```

You will continue building on this data set in the next exercises.

# Add a subquery in FROM

In the previous exercise, you created a data set listing the average home and away goals in each match stage of the 2012/2013 match season.

In this next step, you will turn the main query into a subquery to extract a list of stages where the average home goals in a stage is higher than the overall average for home goals in a match.

Calculate the average home goals and average away goals from the match table for each stage in the FROM clause subquery.
Add a subquery to the WHERE clause that calculates the overall average home goals.
Filter the main query for stages where the average home goals is higher than the overall average.
Select the stage and avg_goals columns from the s subquery into the main query.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the stage and average goals from the subquery
	s.stage,
	ROUND(s.avg_goals,2) AS avg_goals
FROM 
	-- Select the stage and average goals in 2012/2013
	(SELECT
		 stage,
         AVG(home_goal + away_goal) AS avg_goals
	 FROM match
	 WHERE season = '2012/2013'
	 GROUP BY stage) AS s
WHERE 
	-- Filter the main query using the subquery
	s.avg_goals > (SELECT AVG(home_goal	 + away_goal) 
                    FROM match WHERE season = '2012/2013');
```

Quite a few stages were eliminated with this filter. Do you notice anything interesting?

# Add a subquery in SELECT

In the previous exercise, you added a subquery to the FROM statement and selected the stages where the number of average goals in a stage exceeded the overall average number of goals in the 2012/2013 match season. In this final step, you will add a subquery in SELECT to compare the average number of goals scored in each stage to the total.

Create a subquery in SELECT that yields the average goals scored in the 2012/2013 season. Name the new column overall_avg.
Create a subquery in FROM that calculates the average goals scored in each stage during the 2012/2013 season.
Filter the main query for stages where the average goals exceeds the overall average in 2012/2013.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the stage and average goals from s
	s.stage,
    ROUND(s.avg_goals,2) AS avg_goal,
    -- Select the overall average for 2012/2013
    (SELECT AVG(home_goal + away_goal) FROM match WHERE season = '2012/2013') AS overall_avg
FROM 
	-- Select the stage and average goals in 2012/2013 from match
	(SELECT
		 stage,
         AVG(home_goal + away_goal) AS avg_goals
	 FROM match
	 WHERE season = '2012/2013'
	 GROUP BY stage) AS s
WHERE 
	-- Filter the main query using the subquery
	s.avg_goals > (SELECT AVG(home_goal + away_goal) 
                    FROM match WHERE season = '2012/2013');
```

You used 3 subqueries to generate a list of stages that have higher than average goals scored in matches.
