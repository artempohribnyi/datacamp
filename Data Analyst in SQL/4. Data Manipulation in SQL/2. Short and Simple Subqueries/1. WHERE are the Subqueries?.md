In this chapter, you will learn about subqueries in the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses. You will gain an understanding of when subqueries are necessary to construct your dataset and where to best include them in your queries.

# 1. WHERE are the subqueries?

Welcome back! In this chapter, we will cover the use of simple subqueries to extract and transform your data.

# 2. What is a subquery?

A subquery is a query nested inside another query. You can tell that there is a subquery in your SQL statement if you have an additional SELECT statement contained inside parentheses, surrounded by another complete SQL statement. So why is this important? Often, in order to retrieve information you want, you have to perform some intermediary transformations to your data before selecting, filtering, or calculating information. Subqueries are a common way of performing this transformation.

# 3. What do you do with subqueries?

A subquery can be placed in any part of your query -- such as the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, or GROUP BY clause. Where you place it depends on what you want your final data to look like. A subquery can return a variety of information, such as scalar quantities, or numbers, like the ones listed here. A subquery can return a list to use for filtering or joining information, or it can return a table to extract and further transform data.

# 4. Why subqueries?

So why might you need to use a subquery? Subqueries allow you to compare summarized values to detailed data. For example, compare Liverpool's performance to the entire English Premier League. Subqueries also allow you to better structure or reshape your data for multiple purposes, such as determining the highest monthly average of goals scored in the Bundesliga. Finally, subqueries allow you to combine data from tables where you are unable to perform a join, such as getting both the home and away team names into your results table. We'll discuss all of these questions in the coming lessons.

# 5. Simple subqueries

Let's start with the definition of a simple subquery. A simple subquery is a query, nested inside another query, that can be run on its own. The example you see here has a subquery in the WHERE clause -- if you copy the entire inner query, "SELECT the average home goal FROM the match table", you can run it on its own and get a result.

# 6. Simple subqueries

A simple subquery is also evaluated once in the entire query. This means that SQL first processes the information inside the subquery, gets the information it needs, and then moves on to processing information in the OUTER query. Here is the same query you see above. The subquery in WHERE is processed first, generating the overall average of home goals scored. SQL then moves onto the main query, treating the subquery like the single, aggregate value it just generated.

# 7. Subqueries in the WHERE clause

The first type of simple subquery we'll explore is the subquery in the WHERE clause. These are useful for filtering results based on information you'd have to calculate separately beforehand. Let's generate a list of matches in the 2012/2013 season where the number of home goals scored was higher than overall average. You could calculate the average, and then include that number in the main query...

# 8. Subqueries in the WHERE clause

...or you could put the query directly into the WHERE clause, inside parentheses. This way, you have one less manual step to perform before getting the results you need.

# 9. Subquery filtering list with IN

Subqueries are also useful for generating a filtering list. This query answers the question, "Which teams are part of Poland's league?" The "team" table doesn't have the country IDs, but the "match" table has both country and team IDs. By querying a list of hometeam_id's from match where the country_id is 15722, which indicates "Poland", you can generate a list to compare to the team_api_id column IN the WHERE clause.

# 10. Practice time!

Great! Let's practice creating simple subqueries in the WHERE clause.

# Filtering using scalar subqueries

Subqueries are incredibly powerful for performing complex filters and transformations. You can filter data based on single, scalar values using a subquery in ways you cannot by using WHERE statements or joins. Subqueries can also be used for more advanced manipulation of your data set. You will likely encounter subqueries in any real-world setting that uses relational databases.

In this exercise, you will generate a list of matches where the total goals scored (for both teams in total) is more than 3 times the average for games in the matches_2013_2014 table, which includes all games played in the 2013/2014 season.

1. Calculate triple the average home + away goals scored across all matches. This will become your subquery in the next step. Note that this column does not have an alias, so it will be called ?column? in your results.

```
-- Select the average of home + away goals, multiplied by 3
SELECT 
	3 * AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
FROM matches_2013_2014;
```

2. Select the date, home goals, and away goals in the main query.
Filter the main query for matches where the total goals scored exceed the value in the subquery.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the date, home goals, and away goals scored
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM  matches_2013_2014
-- Filter for matches where total goals exceeds 3x the average
WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) > 
       (SELECT 3 * AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
        FROM matches_2013_2014); 
```

This calculation would have been much more difficult without a subquery.

# Filtering using a subquery with a list

Your goal in this exercise is to generate a list of teams that never played a game in their home city. Using a subquery, you will generate a list of unique hometeam_ID values from the unfiltered match table to exclude in the team table's team_api_ID column.

In addition to filtering using a single-value (scalar) subquery, you can create a list of values in a subquery to filter data based on a complex set of conditions. This type of subquery generates a one column reference list for the main query. As long as the values in your list match a column in your main query's table, you don't need to use a join -- even if the list is from a separate table.

Create a subquery in the WHERE clause that retrieves all unique hometeam_ID values from the match table.
Select the team_long_name and team_short_name from the team table. Exclude all values from the subquery in the main query.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team
-- Exclude all values from the subquery
WHERE team_api_id NOT IN
     (SELECT DISTINCT hometeam_id  FROM match);
```

There are 52 teams without any home games recorded in this database. Why do you think that is?

# Filtering with more complex subquery conditions

In the previous exercise, you generated a list of teams that have no home matches listed in the soccer database using a subquery in WHERE. Let's do some further exploration in this database by creating a list of teams that scored 8 or more goals in a home match.

In order to do this, you will construct a subquery in the WHERE statement with its own filtering condition.

Create a subquery in WHERE clause that retrieves all hometeam_ID values from match with a home_goal score greater than or equal to 8.
Select the team_long_name and team_short_name from the team table. Include all values from the subquery in the main query.

```
SELECT
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team 
-- Filter for teams with 8 or more home goals
WHERE team_api_id IN
	  (SELECT hometeam_ID 
       FROM match
       WHERE home_goal >= 8);
```

This is an interesting list of teams!
