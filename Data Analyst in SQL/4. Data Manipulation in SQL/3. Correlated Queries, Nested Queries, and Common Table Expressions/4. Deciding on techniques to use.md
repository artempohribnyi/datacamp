# 1. Deciding on techniques to use

At this point in the course, you're probably wondering why we're covering so many different methods of performing similar tasks.

# 2. Different names for the same thing?

That's a great question. The simplest answer is that yes, there is a lot of overlap between use cases for joins, subqueries, and common table expressions. Many questions that you answer can use these techniques interchangeably without sacrificing query run time or the accuracy of your output. But these techniques are not identical.

# 3. Differentiating Techniques

Let's take a minute to compare the techniques we've been using in this and the previous chapter. Joins allow you to directly combine information from 2 or more tables, and on their own, are mostly limited to simple combinations and aggregations of tables already present in your database. A correlated subquery allows you to combine information between a subquery and a table, or another subquery. These help you simplify your syntax and circumvent the limits of a join -- namely, that you can't join two separate columns in one table, to a single column in another at a time. We saw this in the "match" table, where you can't retrieve the team name from the "team" table for both the home and away teams at the same time. A correlated query can solve that problem. However, it's important to remember that correlated subqueries take a long time to process, and will slow down your query performance. Multiple and nested subqueries are useful when your data requires multi-step transformations before it's in the form you need for your final query. Breaking down the steps of your query process allows for better accuracy and reproducibility in your work. Finally, common table expressions allow you to organize your subqueries sequentially by declaring them at the beginning of your query. Since CTEs are processed one at a time before your main query, you can reference information from a CTE created earlier, thus serving as an alternative to nested subqueries.

# 4. So which do I use?

So which one do you use? Often, it really depends on the database you're using, the field that you're working in, and the questions that you're asking. In general, I recommend that you practice each technique with your own databases to determine which allows you to best use and reuse your queries and generate clear and accurate results.

# 5. Different use cases

Before we move on, I'll share a few examples of questions that each of these approaches can be used for. As you've seen, joins are a universally important skill when working with a database that has more than 1 table. It's fair to say that joins are necessary to understand each of the following techniques. Correlated subqueries are great for matching data from different columns in one or more tables, such as determining who each employee's immediate supervisor is. Multiple and nested subqueries are great for answering questions such as, what is the average deal size closed by each sales representative in the last quarter, which would require multiple steps to transform and prepare before generating the final query. Finally, CTEs are excellent for comparing a large number of disparate pieces of information. For example, you may want to create a summary table examining the marketing, sales, growth, and engineering teams' performance on their key metrics last quarter. With CTEs, you can extract data about each team's performance one after another, and combine them into a single query.

# 6. Let's Practice!

Okay! Let's practice some variations on these techniques to see what your results look like.

# Get team names with a subquery

Let's solve a problem we've encountered a few times in this course so far -- How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?

Out of the 4 techniques we just discussed, this can be performed using subqueries, correlated subqueries, and CTEs. Let's practice creating similar result sets using each of these 3 methods over the next 3 exercises, starting with subqueries in FROM.

1. Create a query that left joins team to match in order to get the identity of the home team. This becomes the subquery in the next step.

```
SELECT 
	m.id, 
    t.team_long_name AS hometeam
-- Left join team to match
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN team as t
ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id;
```

2. Add a second subquery to the FROM statement to get the away team name, changing only the hometeam_id. Left join both subqueries to the match table on the id column.
Warning: if your code is timing out, you have probably made a mistake in the JOIN and tried to join on the wrong fields which caused the table to be too big! Read the provided code and comments carefully, and check your ON conditions!

```
SELECT
	m.date,
    -- Get the home and away team names
    hometeam,
    awayteam,
    m.home_goal,
    m.away_goal
FROM match AS m

-- Join the home subquery to the match table
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT match.id, team.team_long_name AS hometeam
  FROM match
  LEFT JOIN team
  ON match.hometeam_id = team.team_api_id) AS home
ON home.id = m.id

-- Join the away subquery to the match table
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT match.id, team.team_long_name AS awayteam
  FROM match
  LEFT JOIN team
  -- Get the away team ID in the subquery
  ON match.awayteam_id = team.team_api_id) AS away
ON away.id = m.id;
```

This is one clear way to generate a list of team names who played in a match. This is much easier to read than team ID numbers!

# Get team names with correlated subqueries

Let's solve the same problem using correlated subqueries -- How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?

This can easily be performed using correlated subqueries. But how might that impact the performance of your query? Complete the following steps and let's find out!

Please note that your query will run more slowly than the previous exercise!

1. Using a correlated subquery in the SELECT statement, match the team_api_id column from team to the hometeam_id from match.

```
SELECT
    m.date,
   (SELECT team_long_name
    FROM team AS t
    -- Connect the team to the match table
    WHERE t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id) AS hometeam
FROM match AS m;
```

2. Create a second correlated subquery in SELECT, yielding the away team's name.
Select the home and away goal columns from match in the main query.

```
SELECT
    m.date,
    (SELECT team_long_name
     FROM team AS t
     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id) AS hometeam,
    -- Connect the team to the match table
    (SELECT team_long_name
     FROM team AS t
     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.awayteam_id) AS awayteam,
    -- Select home and away goals
     home_goal,
     away_goal
FROM match AS m;
```

The syntax here is much simpler, but if you're working with a large dataset your query may take a while to run!

# Get team names with CTEs

You've now explored two methods for answering the question, How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?

Let's explore the final method - common table expressions. Common table expressions are similar to the subquery method for generating results, mainly differing in syntax and the order in which information is processed.

1. Select id from match and team_long_name from team. Join these two tables together on hometeam_id in match and team_api_id in team.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select match id and team long name
    m.id, 
    t.team_long_name AS hometeam
FROM match AS m
-- Join team to match using team_api_id and hometeam_id
LEFT JOIN team AS t 
ON t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id;
```

2. Declare the query from the previous step as a common table expression. SELECT everything from the CTE into the main query. Your results will not change at this step!

```
-- Declare the home CTE
WITH home AS (
	SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name AS hometeam
	FROM match AS m
	LEFT JOIN team AS t 
	ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id)
-- Select everything from home
SELECT *
FROM home;
```

3. Let's declare the second CTE, away. Join it to the first CTE on the id column.
The date, home_goal, and away_goal columns have been added to the CTEs. SELECT them into the main query.

```
WITH home AS (
  SELECT m.id, m.date, 
  		 t.team_long_name AS hometeam, m.home_goal
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t 
  ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id),
-- Declare and set up the away CTE
away AS (
  SELECT m.id, m.date, 
  		 t.team_long_name AS awayteam, m.away_goal
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t 
  ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id)
-- Select date, home_goal, and away_goal
SELECT 
	home.date,
    home.hometeam,
    away.awayteam,
    home.home_goal,
    away.away_goal
-- Join away and home on the id column
FROM home
INNER JOIN away
ON home.id = away.id;
```

You now know three separate ways to manipulate and transform data to produce a complex query result! This is a great set of skills to have when working with complex relational databases!

# Which technique to use?

The previous three exercises demonstrated that, in many cases, you can use multiple techniques in SQL to answer the same question.

Based on what you learned, which of the following statements is false regarding differences in the use and performance of multiple/nested subqueries, correlated subqueries, and common table expressions?

Although correlated subqueries can reduce the length of your query, they also significantly increase query run time."
