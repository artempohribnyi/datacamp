# 1. Nested subqueries

Building on the previous lesson, another important type of subquery to learn is the nested subquery.

# 2. Nested subqueries?

Nested subqueries are exactly as they sound -- subqueries nested inside other subqueries. As you saw in the previous chapter, information in a database is often not in the format you need to answer a question. Some types of questions you answer may require multiple layers of transformation and filtering of data before you extracting it into the main query.

# 3. A subquery...

Let's start with an example. The query you see here is similar to a previous lesson where we selected the average number of goals scored in a match within each country, and compared it to the overall average using a subquery in SELECT. This third column calculates the difference between each country, and the overall average.

# 4. A subquery...

The resulting table looks like this, with one row for each country, and one column for each of the two calculations.

# 5. ...inside a subquery!

Let's answer a similar question with an additional layer -- How does each month's total goals differ from the monthly average of goals scored? The query here, similar to the previous one, answers this question. Let's take some time to walk through the necessary steps to get this result.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/ba3c0024-a14a-43b8-a248-b45b49ff5176)

# 6. Inner subquery

The subquery logic reads like this -- first, select the sum of goals scored in each month. The month is queried using the EXTRACT function, FROM the date. Here are the results of that first, inner subquery, which includes results for months 1 through 12.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/517a927a-fd6e-4c8f-91ae-d805620daf1b)

# 7. Outer subquery

Next, you can place the subquery into the second, outer subquery to calculate an average of the values generated in the previous table, giving you the average monthly goals scored. Since this result is a scalar subquery, you can now place it in the main query for calculating the final data set.

# 8. Final query

Finally, you can place the entire nested subquery in the SELECT statement, giving you a scalar value to compare to the SUM of goals scored in each month. Here are the first 4 rows of the final query, which generates a sum of goals scored in the month, and a column subtracting the goals scored, from the overall monthly average.

# 9. Correlated nested subqueries

It's important to also note that nested queries can be correlated or uncorrelated. They can also be a combination of the two -- the inner subquery can be correlated, the outer uncorrelated, or vice versa! And each of the correlated subqueries can reference information from an outer subquery, or the main query. It entirely depends on the problem you're looking to solve. Let's look at an example.

# 10. Correlated nested subqueries

Let's look at another example here. This query answers the question, What is each country's average goals scored in a match in the 2011/2012 season? This is fairly similar to the previous chapter, except it takes one additional step.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/f46cf52d-d069-49c1-8e68-2c1c1a7201ff)

# 11. Correlated nested subqueries

It has a second, nested subquery inside the SELECT statement,

# 12. Correlated nested subquery

and the outer subquery has a statement correlating with the main query.

# 13. Correlated nested subqueries

The result you see here is a table with a column that identifies each country's average goals scored in the 2011/2012 season.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/c86da776-b74c-4968-9a84-aa03922ccba6)

# 14. Let's practice!

Okay! Let's practice creating some nested subqueries.

# Nested simple subqueries

Nested subqueries can be either simple or correlated.

Just like an unnested subquery, a nested subquery's components can be executed independently of the outer query, while a correlated subquery requires both the outer and inner subquery to run and produce results.

In this exercise, you will practice creating a nested subquery to examine the highest total number of goals in each season, overall, and during July across all seasons.

Complete the main query to select the season and the max total goals in a match for each season. Name this max_goals.
Complete the first simple subquery to select the max total goals in a match across all seasons. Name this overall_max_goals.
Complete the nested subquery to select the maximum total goals in a match played in July across all seasons.
Select the maximum total goals in the outer subquery. Name this entire subquery july_max_goals.

```
SELECT
	-- Select the season and max goals scored in a match
	season,
    MAX(home_goal + away_goal) AS max_goals,
    -- Select the overall max goals scored in a match
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal) FROM match) AS overall_max_goals,
   -- Select the max number of goals scored in any match in July
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal) 
    FROM match
    WHERE id IN (
          SELECT id FROM match WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = 07)) AS july_max_goals
FROM match
GROUP BY season;
```

You just set up a nested subquery inside your main query to get some interesting data.

# Nest a subquery in FROM

What's the average number of matches per season where a team scored 5 or more goals? How does this differ by country?

Let's use a nested, correlated subquery to perform this operation. In the real world, you will probably find that nesting multiple subqueries is a task you don't have to perform often. In some cases, however, you may find yourself struggling to properly group by the column you want, or to calculate information requiring multiple mathematical transformations (i.e., an AVG of a COUNT).

Nesting subqueries and performing your transformations one step at a time, adding it to a subquery, and then performing the next set of transformations is often the easiest way to yield accurate information about your data. Let's get to it!

1. Generate a list of matches where at least one team scored 5 or more goals.

```
-- Select matches where a team scored 5+ goals
SELECT
	country_id,
    season,
	id
FROM match
WHERE home_goal >= 5 OR away_goal >= 5;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/d933f328-0f60-405c-ad11-7e8ef7da610e)

2. Turn the query from the previous step into a subquery in the FROM statement.
COUNT the match ids generated in the previous step, and group the query by country_id and season.

```
-- Count match ids
SELECT
    country_id,
    season,
    COUNT(id) AS matches
-- Set up and alias the subquery
FROM (
	SELECT
    	country_id,
    	season,
    	id
	FROM match
	WHERE home_goal >= 5 OR away_goal >= 5) 
    AS subquery
-- Group by country_id and season
GROUP BY country_id,
    season;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/cbe3c18e-3300-445d-9a86-fea8554ca4a5)

3. Finally, declare the same query from step 2 as a subquery in FROM with the alias outer_s.
Left join it to the country table using the outer query's country_id column.
Calculate an AVG of high scoring matches per country in the main query.

```
SELECT
	c.name AS country,
    -- Calculate the average matches per season
	AVG(outer_s.matches) AS avg_seasonal_high_scores
FROM country AS c
-- Left join outer_s to country
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT country_id, season,
         COUNT(id) AS matches
  FROM (
    SELECT country_id, season, id
	FROM match
	WHERE home_goal >= 5 OR away_goal >= 5) AS inner_s
  -- Close parentheses and alias the subquery
  GROUP BY country_id, season) AS outer_s
ON c.id = outer_s.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```

This required quite a few steps, but you've got the hang of steps necessary to nest subqueries in FROM that you can apply to other parts of your query as well!
