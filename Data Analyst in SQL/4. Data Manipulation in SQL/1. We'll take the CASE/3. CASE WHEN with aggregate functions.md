# 1. CASE WHEN with aggregate functions

Great job so far! Let's take a look at CASE statements with aggregate functions.

# 2. In CASE you need to aggregate

CASE statements can be used to create columns for categorizing data, and to filter your data in the WHERE clause. You can also use CASE statements to aggregate data based on the result of a logical test.

# 3. COUNTing CASES

Let's say you wanted to prepare a summary table counting the number of home and away games that Liverpool won in each season. If you've created summary tables in Spreadsheets, you can probably visualize the final table, here -- but how do you get a count of Liverpool's wins in each season?

# 4. CASE WHEN with COUNT

You guessed it -- a CASE statement. CASE statements are like any other column in your query, so you can include them inside an aggregate function. Take a look at the CASE statement. The WHEN clause includes a similar logical test to the previous lesson -- did Liverpool play as the home team, AND did the home team score higher than the away team? The difference begins in your THEN clause. Instead of returning a string of text, you return the column identifying the unique match id. When this CASE statement is inside the COUNT function, it COUNTS every id returned by this CASE statement.

# 5. CASE WHEN with COUNT

You then add a second CASE statement for the away team, and group the query by the season. When counting information in a CASE statement, you can return anything you'd like --

# 6. CASE WHEN with COUNT

a number, a string of text, or any column in the table, SQL is COUNTing the number of rows returned by the CASE statement.

# 7. CASE WHEN with SUM

Similarly, you can use the SUM function to calculate a total of any value. Let's say we're interested in the number of home and away goals that Liverpool scored in each season. This is fairly simple to set up -- if the hometeam_id is Liverpool's, return the home_goal value. The ELSE condition is assumed to be NULL, so the query returns the total home_goals scored by Liverpool in each season.

# 8. The CASE is fairly AVG...

You can also use the AVG function with CASE in two key ways. First, you can calculate an average of data. You can do this using CASE in the EXACT same way you used the SUM function. Just change out SUM for AVG in this query, and you instead get the AVG goals Liverpool scored in each season.

# 9. A ROUNDed AVG

You can make the results easier to read using ROUND. ROUND takes 2 arguments -- a numerical value, and the number of decimal points to round the value to.

# 10. A ROUNDed AVG

Place it outside your aggregate CASE statement, and include the number of decimal points at the end. There, that's much easier to read!

# 11. Percentages with CASE and AVG

The second key application of CASE with AVG is in the calculation of percentages. This requires a specific structure in order for your calculation to be accurate. The question we're answering here is, "What percentage of Liverpool's games did they win in each season?" The first component of this CASE statement is a WHEN clause identifying what you're calculating a percentage of -- in this case, how many games did they win? This is tested in the same way as previous slides, and your THEN clause returns a 1. The second component identifies Liverpool's games that they LOST, and returns the value 0. All other matches -- ties, games not involving Liverpool -- are excluded as NULLs. Here are the results of this query ...

# 12. Percentages with CASE and AVG

... and here's the ROUNDed, more readable version of the results.

# 13. Let's practice!

Now it's your turn to practice creating CASE statements with aggregate functions.

# COUNT using CASE WHEN

Do the number of soccer matches played in a given European country differ across seasons? We will use the European Soccer Database to answer this question.

You will examine the number of matches played in 3 seasons within each country listed in the database. This is much easier to explore with each season's matches in separate columns. Using the country and unfiltered match table, you will count the number of matches played in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 match seasons.

1. Create a CASE statement that identifies the id of matches played in the 2012/2013 season. Specify that you want ELSE values to be NULL.
Wrap the CASE statement in a COUNT function and group the query by the country alias.

```
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count games from the 2012/2013 season
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' 
        	THEN m.id ELSE NULL END) AS matches_2012_2013
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/35d3654c-38e5-4cec-bbaa-ca33516ed813)

2. Create 3 CASE WHEN statements counting the matches played in each country across the 3 seasons.
END your CASE statement without an ELSE clause.

```
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count matches in each of the 3 seasons
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2012_2013,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2013_2014,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;
```

The number of matches played in each season seems relatively consistent across countries. Where do you see the largest difference?

# COUNT and CASE WHEN with multiple conditions

In R or Python, you have the ability to calculate a SUM of logical values (i.e., TRUE/FALSE) directly. In SQL, you have to convert these values into 1 and 0 before calculating a sum. This can be done using a CASE statement.

There's one key difference when using SUM to aggregate logical values compared to using COUNT in the previous exercise --

Your goal here is to use the country and match table to determine the total number of matches won by the home team in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 seasons.

Create 3 CASE statements to "count" matches in the '2012/2013', '2013/2014', and '2014/2015' seasons, respectively.
Have each CASE statement return a 1 for every match you want to include, and a 0 for every match to exclude.
Wrap the CASE statement in a SUM to return the total matches played in each season.
Group the query by the country name alias.

```
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Sum the total records in each season where the home team won
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2012_2013,
 	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2013_2014,
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;
```

You now have a second way of calculating the results from the previous exercise.

# Calculating percent with CASE and AVG

CASE statements will return any value you specify in your THEN clause. This is an incredibly powerful tool for robust calculations and data manipulation when used in conjunction with an aggregate statement. One key task you can perform is using CASE inside an AVG function to calculate a percentage of information in your database.

Here's an example of how you set that up:
```
AVG(CASE WHEN condition_is_met THEN 1
         WHEN condition_is_not_met THEN 0 END)
```
With this approach, it's important to accurately specify which records count as 0, otherwise your calculations may not be correct!

Your task is to examine the number of wins, losses, and ties in each country. The matches table is filtered to include all matches from the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 seasons.

1. Create 3 CASE statements to COUNT the total number of home team wins, away team wins, and ties, which will allow you to examine the total number of records.

```
SELECT 
    c.name AS country,
    -- Count the home wins, away wins, and ties in each country
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS home_wins,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS away_wins,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS ties
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```

2. Calculate the percentage of matches tied using a CASE statement inside AVG.
Fill in the logical operators for each statement. Alias your columns as ties_2013_2014 and ties_2014_2015, respectively.

```
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Calculate the percentage of tied games in each season
	AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			END) AS ties_2013_2014,
	AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			END) AS ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```

3. The previous "ties" columns returned values with 14 decimal points, which is not easy to interpret. Use the ROUND function to round to 2 decimal points.

```
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Round the percentage of tied games to 2 decimal points
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END), 2) AS pct_ties_2013_2014,
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END), 2) AS pct_ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```

That's much easier to read. What patterns/differences are you seeing in the results? Who tends to score ties more often?
