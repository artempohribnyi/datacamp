# 1. In CASE things get more complex

Now that you understand the basics of CASE statements, let's set up some more complex logical tests.

# 2. Reviewing CASE WHEN

Previously, we covered CASE statements with one logical test in a WHEN statement, returning outcomes based on whether that test is TRUE or FALSE. This example tests whether home or away goals were higher, and identifies them as wins for the team that had a higher score. Everything ELSE is categorized as a tie. The resulting table has one column identifying matches as one of 3 possible outcomes.

# 3. CASE WHEN ... AND then some

If you want to test multiple logical conditions in a CASE statement, you can use AND inside your WHEN clause. For example, let's see if each match was played, and won, by the team Chelsea. Let's see the CASE statement in this query. Each WHEN clause contains two logical tests -- the first tests if a hometead_id identifies Chelsea, AND then it tests if the home team scored higher than the away team. If both conditions are TRUE, the new column output returns the phrase "Chelsea home win!". The opposite set of conditions are included in a second when statement -- if the awayteam_id belongs to Chelsea, AND scored higher, then the output returns "Chelsea away win!". All other matches are categorized as a loss or tie. Here's the resulting table.

# 4. What ELSE is being excluded?

When testing logical conditions, it's important to carefully consider which rows of your data are part of your ELSE clause, and if they're categorized correctly. Here's the same CASE statement from the previous slide, but the WHERE filter has been removed. Without this filter, your ELSE clause will categorize ALL matches played by anyone, who don't meet these first two conditions, as "Loss or tie :(". Here are the results of this query. A quick look at it shows that the first few matches are all categorized as "Loss or tie", but neither the hometeam_id or awayteam_id belong to Chelsea.

# 5. Correctly categorize your data with CASE

The easiest way to correct for this is to ensure you add specific filters in the WHERE clause that exclude all teams where Chelsea did not play. Here, we specify this by using an OR statement in WHERE, which retrieves only results where the id 8455 is present in the hometeam_id or awayteam_id columns. The resulting table from earlier, with the team IDs in bold here, clearly specifies whether Chelsea was home or away team.

# 6. What's NULL?

It's also important to consider what your ELSE clause is doing. These two queries here are identical, except for the ELSE NULL statement specified in the second. They both return identical results -- a table with quite a few null results. But what if you want to exclude them?

# 7. What are your NULL values doing?

Let's say we're only interested in viewing the results of games where Chelsea won, and we don't care if they lose or tie. Just like in the previous example, simply removing the ELSE clause will still retrieve those results -- and a lot of NULL values.

# 8. Where to place your CASE?

To correct for this, you can treat the entire CASE statement as a column to filter by in your WHERE clause, just like any other column. In order to filter a query by a CASE statement,

# 9. Where to place your CASE?

you include the entire CASE statement, except its alias, in WHERE. You then specify what you want to include, or exclude. For this query, I want to keep all rows where this CASE statement IS NOT NULL. My resulting table now only includes Chelsea's home and away wins -- and I don't need to filter by their team ID anymore!

# 10. Let's practice!

Okay! Let's practice some more complex CASE statements.

# In CASE of rivalry

Barcelona and Real Madrid have been rival teams for more than 80 years. Matches between these two teams are given the name El Clásico (The Classic). In this exercise, you will query a list of matches played between these two rivals.

You will notice in Step 2 that when you have multiple logical conditions in a CASE statement, you may quickly end up with a large number of WHEN clauses to logically test every outcome you are interested in. It's important to make sure you don't accidentally exclude key information in your ELSE clause.

In this exercise, you will retrieve information about matches played between Barcelona (id = 8634) and Real Madrid (id = 8633). Note that the query you are provided with already identifies the Clásico matches using a filter in the WHERE clause.

1. Complete the first CASE statement, identifying Barcelona or Real Madrid as the home team using the hometeam_id column.
Complete the second CASE statement in the same way, using awayteam_id.

```
SELECT 
	date,
	-- Identify the home team as Barcelona or Real Madrid
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
        WHEN hometeam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid CF' END AS home,
    -- Identify the away team as Barcelona or Real Madrid
	CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
        WHEN awayteam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid CF' END AS away
FROM matches_spain
WHERE (awayteam_id = 8634 OR hometeam_id = 8634)
      AND (awayteam_id = 8633 OR hometeam_id = 8633);
```

2. Construct the final CASE statement identifying who won each match. Note there are 3 possible outcomes, but 5 conditions that you need to identify.
Fill in the logical operators to identify Barcelona or Real Madrid as the winner.

```
SELECT 
	date,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END as home,
	CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END as away,
	-- Identify all possible match outcomes
	CASE WHEN home_goal > away_goal AND hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN home_goal > away_goal AND hometeam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid win!'
        WHEN home_goal < away_goal AND awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN home_goal < away_goal AND awayteam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid win!'
        ELSE 'Tie!' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain
WHERE (awayteam_id = 8634 OR hometeam_id = 8634)
      AND (awayteam_id = 8633 OR hometeam_id = 8633);
```

These two teams are fairly evenly matched!

# Filtering your CASE statement

Let's generate a list of matches won by Italy's Bologna team! There are quite a few additional teams in the two tables, so a key part of generating a usable query will be using your CASE statement as a filter in the WHERE clause.

CASE statements allow you to categorize data that you're interested in -- and exclude data you're not interested in. In order to do this, you can use a CASE statement as a filter in the WHERE statement to remove output you don't want to see.

Here is how you might set that up:
```
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE 
    CASE WHEN a > 5 THEN 'Keep'
         WHEN a <= 5 THEN 'Exclude' END = 'Keep';
```
In essence, you can use the CASE statement as a filtering column like any other column in your database. The only difference is that you don't alias the statement in WHERE.

1. Identify Bologna's team ID listed in the teams_italy table by selecting the team_long_name and team_api_id.

```
-- Select team_long_name and team_api_id from team
SELECT
	team_long_name,
	team_api_id
FROM teams_italy
-- Filter for team long name
WHERE team_long_name = 'Bologna';
```

2. Select the season and date that a match was played.
Complete the CASE statement so that only Bologna's home and away wins are identified.

```
-- Select the season and date columns
SELECT 
	season,
    date,
    -- Identify when Bologna won a match
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 
        AND home_goal > away_goal 
        THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 
        AND away_goal > home_goal 
        THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		END AS outcome
FROM matches_italy;
```

3. Select the home_goal and away_goal for each match.
Use the CASE statement in the WHERE clause to filter all NULL values generated by the statement in the previous step.

```
-- Select the season, date, home_goal, and away_goal columns
SELECT 
	season,
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM matches_italy
WHERE 
-- Exclude games not won by Bologna
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal > home_goal THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		END IS NOT NULL;
```

You now have details on every match in this database where Bologna won. We will work on adding more useful information to your queries later in this course.
