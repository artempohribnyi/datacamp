# 1. Bringing it all Together

Congratulations! You've made it to the final lesson of the course.

# 2. What you've learned so far

Throughout the course we've covered a wide variety of methods for transforming, manipulating, and calculating data to answer a wide variety of questions in SQL. Specifically, you've learned how to use CASE statements for categorizing, aggregating, and calculating information, and how to use simple subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses. You also learned how to use nested and correlated subqueries, and common table expressions to extract, match, and organize large amounts of data in order to generate a final table. Finally, you learned how to use some of the many window functions available to you in SQL.

# 3. Let's do a case study!

Let's put several of these topics together to answer one question about your data set -- Who defeated Manchester United in the 2013/2014 season?

# 4. Steps to construct the query

In the following exercises, you will generate a data set that tackles one of the issues we've explored during this course -- namely, that it's difficult to retrieve the names of teams who played in a given match. Since this isn't feasible with joins, we will accomplish it with common table expressions. We'll also be using CASE statements to categorize the outcomes of matches based on whether or not Manchester United won a particular match. Finally, we'll be ranking matches by the number of goals they lost the match using a window function.

# 5. Getting the database for yourself

If Manchester United happens to be a team that you favor, or if there are other European teams you consider a rival to your favorite team, I encourage you to explore the European Soccer Database for yourself and create similar, or completely different queries to answer your questions.

# 6. Let's practice!

Okay! Let's get to it!

# Setting up the home team CTE

In this course, we've covered ways in which you can use CASE statements, subqueries, common table expressions, and window functions in your queries to structure a data set that best meets your needs. For this exercise, you will be using all of these concepts to generate a list of matches in which Manchester United was defeated during the 2014/2015 English Premier League season.

Your first task is to create the first query that filters for matches where Manchester United played as the home team. This will become a common table expression in a later exercise.

Create a CASE statement that identifies each match as a win, lose, or tie for Manchester United.
Fill out the logical operators for each WHEN clause in the CASE statement (equals, greater than, less than).
Join the tables on home team ID from match, and team_api_id from team.
Filter the query to only include games from the 2014/2015 season where Manchester United was the home team.

```
SELECT 
	m.id, 
    t.team_long_name,
    -- Identify matches as home/away wins or ties
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
		WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM match AS m
-- Left join team on the home team ID and team API id
LEFT JOIN team AS t 
ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id
WHERE 
	-- Filter for 2014/2015 and Manchester United as the home team
	season = '2014/2015'
	AND t.team_long_name = 'Manchester United';
```

This query you wrote will become the first common table

# Setting up the away team CTE

Great job! Now that you have a query identifying the home team in a match, you will perform a similar set of steps to identify the away team. Just like the previous step, you will join the match and team tables. Each of these two queries will be declared as a Common Table Expression in the following step.

The primary difference in this query is that you will be joining the tables on awayteam_id, and reversing the match outcomes in the CASE statement.

When altering CASE statement logic in your own work, you can reverse either the logical condition (i.e., home_goal > away_goal) or the outcome in THEN -- just make sure you only reverse one of the two!

Complete the CASE statement syntax.
Fill out the logical operators identifying each match as a win, loss, or tie for Manchester United.
Join the table on awayteam_id, and team_api_id.

```
SELECT 
	m.id, 
    t.team_long_name,
    -- Identify matches as home/away wins or ties
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
		WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
-- Join team table to the match table
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN team AS t 
ON awayteam_id = t.team_api_id
WHERE 
	-- Filter for 2014/2015 and Manchester United as the away team
	season = '2014/2015'
	AND t.team_long_name = 'Manchester United';
```

You correctly constructed a CASE statement to accurately identify matches as a win or loss for Manchester United. This will become your second common table expression.

# Putting the CTEs together

Now that you've created the two subqueries identifying the home and away team opponents, it's time to rearrange your query with the home and away subqueries as Common Table Expressions (CTEs). You'll notice that the main query includes the phrase, SELECT DISTINCT. Without identifying only DISTINCT matches, you will return a duplicate record for each game played.

Continue building the query to extract all matches played by Manchester United in the 2014/2015 season.

Declare the home and away CTEs before your main query.
Join your CTEs to the match table using a LEFT JOIN.
Select the relevant data from the CTEs into the main query.
Select the date from match, team names from the CTEs, and home/ away goals from match in the main query.

```
-- Set up the home team CTE
WITH home AS (
  SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
	  CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
		   WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss' 
  		   ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id),
-- Set up the away team CTE
away AS (
  SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
	  CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
		   WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss' 
  		   ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id)
-- Select team names, the date and goals
SELECT DISTINCT
    m.date,
    home.team_long_name AS home_team,
    away.team_long_name AS away_team,
    m.home_goal,
    m.away_goal
-- Join the CTEs onto the match table
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN home ON m.id = home.id
LEFT JOIN away ON m.id = away.id
WHERE m.season = '2014/2015'
      AND (home.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' 
           OR away.team_long_name = 'Manchester United');
```

You wrote a query that extracted data from two common table expressions. You can scale up the number of CTEs as necessary, depending on your data.

# Add a window function

Fantastic! You now have a result set that retrieves the match date, home team, away team, and the goals scored by each team. You have one final component of the question left -- how badly did Manchester United lose in each match?

In order to determine this, let's add a window function to the main query that ranks matches by the absolute value of the difference between home_goal and away_goal. This allows us to directly compare the difference in scores without having to consider whether Manchester United played as the home or away team!

The equation is complete for you -- all you need to do is properly complete the window function!

Set up the CTEs so that the home and away teams each have a name, ID, and score associated with them.
Select the date, home team name, away team name, home goal, and away goals scored in the main query.
Rank the matches and order by the difference in scores in descending order.

```
-- Set up the home team CTE
WITH home AS (
  SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
	  CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
		   WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss' 
  		   ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id),
-- Set up the away team CTE
away AS (
  SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name,
	  CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
		   WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win' 
  		   ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
  FROM match AS m
  LEFT JOIN team AS t ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id)
-- Select columns and and rank the matches by goal difference
SELECT DISTINCT
    m.date,
    home.team_long_name AS home_team,
    away.team_long_name AS away_team,
    m.home_goal, m.away_goal,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ABS(home_goal - away_goal) DESC) as match_rank
-- Join the CTEs onto the match table
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN home ON m.id = home.id
LEFT JOIN away ON m.id = away.id
WHERE m.season = '2014/2015'
      AND ((home.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' AND home.outcome = 'MU Loss')
      OR (away.team_long_name = 'Manchester United' AND away.outcome = 'MU Loss'));
```

This is an interesting list of matches. You can easily modify this query for any team of your choice. Finally, if you liked this course, let your instructor know by tweeting them at @monakay!
