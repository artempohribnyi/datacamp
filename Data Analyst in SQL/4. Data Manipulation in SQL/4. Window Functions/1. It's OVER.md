You will learn about window functions and how to pass aggregate functions along a dataset. You will also learn how to calculate running totals and partitioned averages.

# 1. Window Functions

Great job! You now have experience transforming data using simple subqueries, correlated subqueries, and common table expressions.

# 2. Working with aggregate values

Let's tackle another limitation you've likely encountered in SQL -- the fact that you have to group results when using aggregate functions. If you try to retrieve additional information without grouping by every single non-aggregate value, your query will return an error. Thus, you can't compare aggregate values to non-aggregate data.

# 3. Introducing window functions!

You can work around this limitation using a window function. Window functions are a class of functions that perform calculations on a result set that has already been generated, also referred to as a "window". You can use window functions to perform aggregate calculations without having to group your data, just as you did with a subquery in SELECT. You can also use them to calculate information such as running totals, rankings, and moving averages.

# 4. What's a window function?

So what's a window function? How do you use it? Let's start with a query from chapter 2, where we answered the question, "how many goals were scored in each match in 2011/2012, and how did that compare to the average?" This query selects two columns from match table, and then used a subquery in SELECT to pass the overall average along the data set without aggregating the results.

# 5. What's a window function?

The same results can be generated using the clause common to all window functions -- the OVER clause. Instead of writing a subquery, calculate the AVG of home_goal and away_goal, and follow it with the OVER clause. This clause tells SQL to "pass this aggregate value over this existing result set." The results are identical to the previous statement that used a subquery in SELECT, with a simpler syntax and faster processing time.

# 6. Generate a RANK

Another simple type of column you can generate with a window function is a RANK. A RANK simply creates a column numbering your data set from highest to lowest, or lowest to highest, based on a column that you specify. Let's take the same query as the previous example, without the window function, and use it to answer the question -- what is the RANK of matches based on the number of goals scored?

# 7. Generate a RANK

We can answer this using the RANK window function. In order to set this up, let's add a new column in SELECT as you see here. To create the rank, you start with the RANK function, using parentheses, followed by the OVER clause. Inside the OVER clause, include the ORDER BY clause, and the column or columns you want to use to generate the rank. By default, the RANK function orders the results and ranking from smallest to largest values. In the case of our data set here, this isn't particularly informative.

# 8. Generate a RANK

You can easily correct this by adding the DESC function to reverse the order of the rank, just as you would if you were using ORDER BY at the end of your query. You'll notice that the RANK function automatically ties identical values, such as the first 2 results, and then skips the next value in the rank.

# 9. Key differences

There are a few key considerations when using window functions. First, window functions are processed after the entire query except the final ORDER BY statement. Thus, the window function uses the result set to calculate information, as opposed to using the database directly. Second, it's important to know that window functions are available in PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, but not in SQLite.

# 10. Let's practice!

Okay, let's practice some simple window functions using the OVER clause!

# The match is OVER

The OVER() clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in SELECT. The OVER() clause offers significant benefits over subqueries in select -- namely, your queries will run faster, and the OVER() clause has a wide range of additional functions and clauses you can include with it that we will cover later on in this chapter.

In this exercise, you will revise some queries from previous chapters using the OVER() clause.

Select the match ID, country name, season, home, and away goals from the match and country tables.
Complete the query that calculates the average number of goals scored overall and then includes the aggregate value in each row using a window function.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the id, country name, season, home, and away goals
	m.id, 
    c.name AS country, 
    m.season,
	m.home_goal,
	m.away_goal,
    -- Use a window to include the aggregate average in each row
	AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN country AS c ON m.country_id = c.id;
```

The basic window function with an OVER clause functions just like a subquery in SELECT.

# What's OVER here?

Window functions allow you to create a RANK of information according to any variable you want to use to sort your data. When setting this up, you will need to specify what column/calculation you want to use to calculate your rank. This is done by including an ORDER BY clause inside the OVER() clause. Below is an example:

SELECT 
    id,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal) AS rank
FROM match;
In this exercise, you will create a data set of ranked matches according to which leagues, on average, score the most goals in a match.

Select the league name and average total goals scored from league and match.
Complete the window function so it calculates the rank of average goals scored across all leagues in the database.
Order the rank by the average total of home and away goals scored.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank each league according to the average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal)) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/662cc134-ca72-40eb-b90c-0e0fb691ed89)

You'll notice that the default order is from smallest to largest value -- in this case, the Polish league tends to have the fewest goals scored on average.

# Flip OVER your results

In the last exercise, the rank generated in your query was organized from smallest to largest. By adding DESC to your window function, you can create a rank sorted from largest to smallest.
```
SELECT 
    id,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY home_goal DESC) AS rank
FROM match;
```

Complete the same parts of the query as the previous exercise.
Complete the window function to rank each league from highest to lowest average goals scored.
Order the main query by the rank you just created.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank leagues in descending order by average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(-(m.home_goal + m.away_goal))) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;
```

Unlike a subquery in SELECT, your window function will apply the filter that you include in your WHERE clause.
