# 1. Window Partitions

You've done a great job working with the OVER clause so far! The real bread and butter of window functions that differentiates them from subqueries in select, are in the functions you can add within the OVER clause.

# 2. OVER and PARTITION BY

One important statement you can add to your OVER clause is PARTITION BY. A partition allows you to calculate separate values for different categories established in a partition. This is one way to calculate different aggregate values within one column of data, and pass them down a data set, instead of having to calculate them in different columns. The syntax for a partition is fairly simple. Just like before, use an aggregate function to compute a calculation, such as the AVG of the home_goal column. You then add the OVER clause afterward, and inside the parentheses, state PARTITION BY, followed by the column you want to partition the average by. This will then return the overall average for, or PARTITIONed BY each season.

# 3. Partition your data

Let's take a look at how this works in a query. This is the example query from the previous lesson, answering the question, "How many goals were scored in each match, and how did that compare to the overall average?" This is accomplished using the OVER clause, and the query returns the date, goals scored, and overall average.

# 4. Partition your data

Let's expand on the previous question, and instead ask, "How many goals were scored in each match, and how did that compare to the season's average?" We can do this by adding a PARTITION BY clause to the OVER clause from the previous slide. Specifying, "PARTITION BY season" returns each season's average on each row, in accordance to the season that each record belongs to. As you can see, rows 1 and 2 are matches played in the 2011/2012 season, and the season_avg column contains the 2011/2012 season average. Rows 3 and 4 are part of the 2012/2013 season, and return the 2012/2013 season average.

# 5. PARTITION by Multiple Columns

You can also use PARTITION to calculate values broken out by multiple columns. In the query you see here, the OVER clause contains two columns to partition the AVG goals scored--season, and country. The result set returns the average goals scored broken out by season and country. In row 1, a match was played in Belgium in the 2011/2012 season, and had 1 goal scored throughout the match. This is compared to the 2.88, which is the average goals scored in Belgium in the 2011/2012 season.

# 6. PARTITION BY considerations

PARTITION BY is a pretty straight forward addition to the OVER clause. You can partition calculations by 1 or more columns as necessary to answer a question you may have. Additionally, you can use a PARTITION with any kind of window function -- calculation, rank, or others that we will discuss further in the following lesson.

# 7. Let's practice!

For now, let's practice calculating window partitions on our match data.

# PARTITION BY a column

The PARTITION BY clause allows you to calculate separate "windows" based on columns you want to divide your results. For example, you can create a single column that calculates an overall average of goals scored for each season.

In this exercise, you will be creating a data set of games played by Legia Warszawa (Warsaw League), the top ranked team in Poland, and comparing their individual game performance to the overall average for that season.

Where do you see more outliers? Are they Legia Warszawa's home or away games?

Complete the two window functions that calculate the home and away goal averages. Partition the window functions by season to calculate separate averages for each season.
Filter the query to only include matches played by Legia Warszawa, id = 8673.

```
SELECT
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
		 ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
    -- Calculate the average goals scored partitioned by season
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_homeavg,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_awayavg
FROM match
-- Filter the data set for Legia Warszawa matches only
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673 
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;
```

You've generated an ordered data set with window functions to compare each game's score to averages for that season.

# PARTITION BY multiple columns

The PARTITION BY clause can be used to break out window averages by multiple data points (columns). You can even calculate the information you want to use to partition your data! For example, you can calculate average goals scored by season and by country, or by the calendar year (taken from the date column).

In this exercise, you will calculate the average number home and away goals scored Legia Warszawa, and their opponents, partitioned by the month in each season.

Construct two window functions partitioning the average of home and away goals by season and month.
Filter the dataset by Legia Warszawa's team ID (8673) so that the window calculation only includes matches involving them.

```
SELECT 
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
         ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
	-- Calculate average goals partitioned by season and month
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
         	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)) AS season_mo_home,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
         	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)) AS season_mo_away
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;
```

You successfully partitioned your averages by each month in the season. In the next lesson, we'll expand on the usefulness of information generated with window functions.
