Statistics are all around us, from marketing to sales to healthcare. The ability to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data is not only extremely valuable, but it is also becoming commonplace to expect roles that are not traditionally analytical to understand the fundamental concepts of statistics. This course will equip you with the necessary skills to feel confident in working with analyzing data to draw insights. You'll be introduced to common methods used for summarizing and describing data, learn how probability can be applied to commercial scenarios, and discover how experiments are conducted to understand relationships and patterns. You'll work with real-world datasets including crime data in London, England, and sales data from an online retail company!
