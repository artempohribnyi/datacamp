It's time to explore more probability distributions. You'll learn about the binomial distribution for visualizing the probability of binary outcomes, and one of the most important distributions in statistics, the normal distribution. You'll see how distributions can be described by their shape, along with discovering the Poisson distribution and its role in calculating the probabilities of events occuring over time. You'll also gain an understanding of the central limit theorem!
