It's time to explore more probability distributions. You'll learn about the binomial distribution for visualizing the probability of binary outcomes, and one of the most important distributions in statistics, the normal distribution. You'll see how distributions can be described by their shape, along with discovering the Poisson distribution and its role in calculating the probabilities of events occuring over time. You'll also gain an understanding of the central limit theorem!

# 1. The binomial distribution

Now let's learn about another distribution - the binomial distribution.

# 2. Coin flipping

We'll start by flipping a coin, which has two possible outcomes, heads or tails, each with a probability of fifty percent.

# 3. Binary outcomes

This is an example of a binary outcome, where two possible values can occur. We could also represent these outcomes as a one or a zero, a success or a failure, and a win or a loss.

# 4. One coin flip many times

We can perform multiple flips of a single coin and log the results, such as here where heads is represented as a one, and tails as a zero.

# 5. Binomial distribution

The binomial distribution describes the probability of the number of successes in a sequence of independent events. For example, it can tell us the probability of getting some number of heads in a sequence of coin flips. Note that this is a discrete distribution since we're working with a countable outcome. The binomial distribution can be described using two parameters, n and p. n represents the total number of events being performed, and p is the probability of success, in this case, heads.

# 6. Binomial distribution

Here's what the distribution looks like for 10 coin flips. We have the biggest chance of getting five heads, and a much smaller chance of getting zero or 10 heads.

# 7. Probability of 7 or fewer heads

As with other distributions, we can calculate the probability of outcomes by adding together the area. If we want the probability of getting seven or fewer heads from 10 flips, we add up the probability of rolling zero heads, one head, two heads and so on up to and including seven heads. There is a ninety-four-point-five percent probability of rolling seven or fewer heads.

# 8. Probability of 8 or more heads

Likewise, to calculate the probability of eight or more heads, we can subtract the probability of seven or fewer heads from the total probability, or one. This gives a result of around five-point-five percent probability.

# 9. Expected value

The expected value of the binomial distribution can be calculated by multiplying n by p. The expected number of heads from flipping 10 coins is 10 times zero-point-five, which is five. If we don't know p, but know n and the expected value, we can calculate p through dividing the expected value by n.

# 10. Independence

In order for the binomial distribution to apply, each event must be independent, so the outcome of one event shouldn't have an effect on the next. For example, if we're picking randomly from these cards with zeros and ones, we have a 50-50 chance of getting a zero or a one. If probabilities change based on the outcome of a prior event, the binomial distribution does not apply.

# 11. Independence

But if we're sampling without replacement, the probabilities for the second event are different due to the outcome of the first event. Since these events aren't independent, we can't calculate accurate probabilities for this situation using the binomial distribution.

# 12. General applications

The binomial distribution can be used in any scenario where independent events produce binary outcomes, and does not require equal probability for each outcome. Examples include clinical trials measuring effectiveness of a drug, where the outcome is whether the drug worked or not, or betting on the result of a sports match, where the bettor can either win or lose.

# 13. Let's practice!

Time to explore binary outcomes using the binomial distribution.

# Recognizing a binomial distribution

Recall that a binomial distribution counts the number of successes in independent events.

Four scenarios are provided below; your task is to choose which one describes a binomial distribution based on the type of data described.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/6109b7fe-008f-45bf-8a61-73641ab8c251)

As the lottery ticket has a target of four numbers, it can be classed as a success or failure depending on whether that many numbers were matched or not.

# How probability affects the binomial distribution

Recall that the binomial distribution can be described by two parameters, *n* and *p*.

To examine how these parameters affect the distribution, three plots have been provided representing the probability of closing between one and 12 sales per week for three sales people. The probability, *p*, is different for each individual.

Your task is to select which sales person has the highest probability of closing nine or more sales per week.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/b26ed379-509c-46e8-9d63-66de5ee327a0)

See how James' distribution has higher probabilities towards the right of the plot, representing an increased probability of closing more sales per week.

# Identifying n and p

Great work recognizing which sales person had the highest probability of closing nine or more sales.

Recall that the shape of a binomial distribution is determined by the parameters *n* and *p*, and the expected value is represented by the bar with the highest peak.

But can you spot what *n* and *p* are for James' sales distribution?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/62007f1d-5350-4d81-944f-d9f65825ea67)

The distributions shows *n* equals 12 as there are a maximum 12 possible sales per week, and eight is the most likely outcome, meaning *p* can be found through dividing eight by 12, resulting in 0.67.
