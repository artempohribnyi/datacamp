# 1. Congratulations!

Fantastic work on completing the course!

# 2. What you've covered

You learned about data types and the different branches of statistics, then worked with measures of center and measures of spread.

# 3. What you've covered

You learned about the probability of independent events, and conditional probability for dependent events. You discovered probability distributions, and saw how to use the area of a distribution to calculate probability!

# 4. What you've covered

You moved on to the binomial, normal, and Poisson distributions! You also discovered the importance of the central limit theorem.

# 5. What you've covered

Finally, you learned the fundamentals of hypothesis testing. You were introduced to the null and alternative hypotheses and saw how randomization, treatment, control, and blinding can be used to strengthen experiments. You saw how correlation helps to quantify the relationships between variables. Lastly, you saw how alpha and p-values can be used to draw meaningful conclusions from hypothesis tests!

# 6. Where to from here?

So where to now? Statistics is one component of data science. If you want to learn more we have courses introducing data science! Or perhaps you're interested in machine learning, which combines statistics and programming to build predictive models!

# 7. Thank you!

Congratulations again, and thank you for taking the course! I hope you enjoy applying your newfound statistics knowledge!
