# 1. Conditional probability

So far we have looked at independent probability, but what do we do if the outcome of one event impacts another event?

# 2. Multiple meetings

Let's revisit our sales meeting scenario. Brian has been selected to attend a potential client meeting, so his name is no longer in the box. However, we now have another potential client who wants to meet at the same time, so we need to pick another salesperson. Brian is unavailable, so we'll pick between the remaining three. This is called sampling without replacement since we aren't replacing the name we already pulled out.

# 3. Multiple meetings

This time, Claire is picked. The probability of this is one out of three or about 33%.

# 4. Dependent events

This is an example of dependent events, where the outcome of the first event changes the probability of the second. The probability that Claire is picked second depends on who gets picked first.

# 5. Dependent events

If Claire is picked first, there's zero percent probability that Claire will be picked second.

# 6. Dependent events

If someone else is picked first, there's a 33% probability that Claire will be picked second. In general, when sampling without replacement, each pick is dependent.

# 7. Conditional probability

Conditional probability is a method used to calculate the chances of dependent events because the probability of one event is conditional on the outcome of another. This occurs frequently in real-life. For example, the probability of a train arriving on time, given the one before was delayed, or the probability of a movie being successful, given the director previously won an Oscar. Notice that these scenarios require some prior knowledge - if we don't know that the previous train was late then we may not accurately estimate the probability of the current train being on time. Therefore, context or subject-matter expertise is critical when using conditional probability.

# 8. Venn diagrams

We can visualize conditional probability using a Venn diagram. This is a technique used to display the possible outcomes of multiple events, and the overlap where both events can occur. Where the two events are dependent, a Venn diagram's overlap will change based on the results of the first event.

# 9. Kitchen sales over $150

As an example, we can apply conditional probability to our online sales data to calculate the chance of an order being worth more than 150 dollars, given it is for kitchen products. There are 581 orders worth over 150 dollars, and 161 orders for kitchen products. 20 kitchen product orders are worth over 150 dollars.

# 10. Kitchen sales over $150

To calculate the conditional probability we divide the 20 orders meeting both conditions by the total number of orders, 1767, then divide this result by the proportion of all orders that are for kitchen products, which is 161 divided by 1767. As both of these values involve dividing by total orders we can cancel out the 1767, so the probability is 20 divided by 161, or 12-point-four percent.

# 11. The order of events matters

To highlight how the probability is conditional for dependent events, we can switch the order of events. Let's calculate the conditional probability of an order being for kitchen products, given the order is worth more than 150 dollars. We again divide the 20 orders meeting both conditions by the total number of orders, and this time we divide the result by the proportion of all orders that are over 150 dollars. Again we can cancel out the 1767, so the probability is 20 divided by 581, or three-point-four percent.

# 12. Conditional probability formula

The general formula for conditional probability is shown here. The probability of event A, given event B, is equal to the sum of the probabilities of both events, divided by the probability of event B.

# 13. Let's practice!

What is the probability that we will enjoy the next exercises, given we made it to the end of the video?

# Dependent vs. Independent events

It can be tricky to decide whether events are dependent or independent, but understanding this is crucial when correctly calculating the probability of event outcomes!

In this exercise, you have been provided with some scenarios and need to classify them as dependent or independent.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/70a8df24-5e92-4483-9c4c-cd8635ca619c)

 When trying to determine if two events are dependent, ask yourself whether the outcome of one changes the probability of another.

# Orders of more than 10 basket products

Recall that the order in which dependent events occur affects conditional probability.

In this exercise, you will need to use the image to calculate the conditional probability that an order from the online retail dataset will be for more than 10 items, given the order is for Basket products.

This works out as a chance of approximately 3.4%, so fairly unlikely!
