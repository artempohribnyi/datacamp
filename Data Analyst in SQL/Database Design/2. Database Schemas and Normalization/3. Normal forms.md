# 1. Normal forms

Welcome back!

# 2. Normalization

Earlier, I introduced the concept of normalization. I gave this simplified definition. Here is a more formal definition provided by Adrienne Watt. Pause to read it. So what are these levels?

# 3. Normal forms (NF)

There are different extents to which you can normalize. These are called normal forms. Below is a list of them from least to most normalized. Each has its own set of rules, and some build on top of each other. We'll only cover the first three normal forms.

# 4. 1NF rules

Let's begin with the first normal form. To comply with 1NF, each record must be unique and each cell must hold one value. Here's a simple table with student ids and emails, along with courses completed. All these rows are unique, but the courses_completed column has more than one course in two records.

# 5. In 1NF form

To rectify this, we can split the original table as such. Now, all the records are unique and each column has one value.

# 6. 2NF

Next is 2NF, which must satisfy 1NF. Beyond that, if the primary key is one column, then the table is 2NF. A composite primary key is when a primary key is made up of two or more columns. If the table has a composite primary key, then each non-key column must be dependent on all the keys. Let's look at a concrete example. In this table, we have the student and course id as a composite primary key. We then review the other columns and their dependence on these two keys. First is the instructor, which isn't dependent on the student_id - only the course_id. Meaning an instructor solely depends on the course, not the students who take the course. The same goes for the instructor_id column. However, the percent completed is dependent on both the student and the course id.

# 7. In 2NF form

To convert it, we can create two new tables that satisfy the conditions of 2NF.

# 8. 3NF

On to 3NF, where you might've correctly guessed requires 2NF to be satisfied. 3NF doesn't allow transitive dependencies. This means that non-primary key columns can't depend on other non-primary key columns. Let's take a look at an example. Course_id is the primary key so we can ignore this column. Instructor_id and Instructor definitely depend on each other. Tech does not depend on the instructor as an instructor can teach different technologies.

# 9. In 3NF

We can replace the table from before into these two tables to meet 3NF criteria. These tables have no transitive dependencies and they also meet 2NF as there are no composite primary keys.

# 10. Data anomalies

We've covered these first three normal forms that increase in normalization. It's time to consider why we would want to put effort into normalizing a database even more? Why isn't 1NF enough? A database that isn't normalized enough is prone to three types of anomaly errors: update, insertion, and deletion.

# 11. Update anomaly

An update anomaly is a data inconsistency that can arise when updating a database with redundancy. For example, take this simple table. It holds the id's and email of students, and their enrolled courses. If we want to update the email of student 520, we would have to update multiple records. It may sound easy to update multiple records, but it's risky because it depends on the user updating- if they remember this redundancy. And this is a simple example - as we scale, it's harder to keep track of these redundancies.

# 12. Insertion anomaly

An insertion anomaly is when you are unable to add a new record due to missing attributes. For example, if a student signs up for DataCamp, but doesn't start any courses, they cannot be put into this database. The only exception is if the enrolled_in column can accept nulls. The dependency between columns in the same table unintentionally restricts what can be inserted into the table.

# 13. Deletion anomaly

A deletion anomaly happens when you delete a record and unintentionally delete other data. For example, if you were to delete any of these students, you would lose the course information provided in the columns enrolled_in and taught_by. This could be resolved if we put that information in another table.

# 14. Data anomalies

The more normalized the database, the less prone it will be to these anomalies. For example, most 3NF tables can't have an update, insertion, and deletion anomalies. This makes normalization sound great. But, don't forget the downsides of normalization from the last video! Remember those long queries?

# 15. Let's practice!

Let's practice!

# Converting to 1NF

In the next three exercises, you'll be working through different tables belonging to a car rental company. Your job is to explore different schemas and gradually increase the normalization of these schemas through the different normal forms. At this stage, we're not worried about relocating the data, but rearranging the tables.

A table called customers has been loaded, which holds information about customers and the cars they have rented.

Question

1. Does the customers table meet 1NF criteria?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/86240899-7079-48f4-8a79-d0d1a9a07a76)

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/ea80a9a0-7f85-4344-8262-f011c925494b)

2. cars_rented holds one or more car_ids and invoice_id holds multiple values. Create a new table to hold individual car_ids and invoice_ids of the customer_ids who've rented those cars.
Drop two columns from customers table to satisfy 1NF

```
-- Create a new table to hold the cars rented by customers
CREATE TABLE cust_rentals (
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  car_id VARCHAR(128) NULL,
  invoice_id VARCHAR(128) NULL
);

-- Drop a column from customers table to satisfy 1NF
ALTER TABLE customers
DROP COLUMN cars_rented,
DROP COLUMN invoice_id;

```

We now have two tables: (1) customers which holds customer information and (2) cust_rentals which holds the car_ids rented by different customer_ids. This satisfies 1NF. In a real situation, we would need to fill the new table before dropping any columns.

# Converting to 2NF

Let's try normalizing a bit more. In the last exercise, you created a table holding customer_ids and car_ids. This has been expanded upon and the resulting table, customer_rentals, has been loaded for you. Since you've got 1NF down, it's time for 2NF.

Question

1. Why doesn't customer_rentals meet 2NF criteria?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/b81d67b5-0546-4f0d-972c-f4f1a9e0f2c6)

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/132721e0-483a-46bb-89b9-6fbd8a74ef5f)

2. Create a new table for the non-key columns that were conflicting with 2NF criteria.
Drop those non-key columns from customer_rentals.

```
-- Create a new table to satisfy 2NF
CREATE TABLE cars (
  car_id VARCHAR(256) NULL,
  model VARCHAR(128),
  manufacturer VARCHAR(128),
  type_car VARCHAR(128),
  condition VARCHAR(128),
  color VARCHAR(128)
);

-- Drop columns in customer_rentals to satisfy 2NF
ALTER TABLE customer_rentals
DROP COLUMN model,
DROP COLUMN manufacturer, 
DROP COLUMN type_car,
DROP COLUMN condition,
DROP COLUMN color;
```
model, manufacturer, type_car, conditions, and colors depend on car_id, but are independent of the other two primary keys, customer_id and start_date. The customer or start date cannot change these attributes. Hence, we have put these columns in a new table and dropped them from customer_rentals.

# Converting to 3NF

Last, but not least, we are at 3NF. In the last exercise, you created a table holding car_idss and car attributes. This has been expanded upon. For example, car_id is now a primary key. The resulting table, rental_cars, has been loaded for you.

Question

1. Why doesn't rental_cars meet 3NF criteria?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/a05b1785-2d50-4757-bad3-d88b3e76a513)

2. Create a new table for the non-key columns that were conflicting with 3NF criteria.
Drop those non-key columns from rental_cars.

```
-- Create a new table to satisfy 3NF
CREATE TABLE car_model(
  model VARCHAR(128),
  manufacturer VARCHAR(128),
  type_car VARCHAR(128)
);

-- Drop columns in rental_cars to satisfy 3NF
ALTER TABLE rental_cars
DROP COLUMN manufacturer, 
DROP COLUMN type_car;
```
You did it - the first three normal forms! Can you see how these 3NF tables help reduce data redundancy and potential data anomalies?
