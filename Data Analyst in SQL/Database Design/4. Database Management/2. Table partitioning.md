# 1. Table partitioning

Welcome back! Now that we've covered access control of databases, it's time for something completely different: database partitioning.

# 2. Why partition?

Before we talk about what table partitioning, let's talk a bit about the why. When tables grow — we're talking hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes here — queries tend to become slow. Even when we've set indices correctly, these indices can become so large they don't fit into memory. At a certain point, it can make sense to split a table up into multiple smaller parts. We call the process of doing this 'partitioning'.

# 3. Data modeling refresher

Note that, looking at the data modeling layers we saw in the first chapter, partitioning fits into the physical data model. Indeed, logically, the data you'll access or update is still the same. The difference is we distribute the data over several physical entities.

# 4. Vertical partitioning

When we talk about partitioning, there are two different types of partitioning. The first one we'll introduce is vertical partitioning. You saw in the second chapter that to normalize a table, you can use foreign keys and create new tables. As you saw, it can help you reduce redundant data. Vertical partitioning goes one step further and splits up a table vertically by its columns, even when it's already fully normalized.

# 5. Vertical partitioning: an example

In this example, you start with a table containing product data. It has four columns. After vertical partitioning, you could end up with two tables: one for the first three columns, and another for the last column. We can link them through a shared key. Let's say the fourth column, containing a long description, is retrieved very rarely. We could store the second table on a slower medium. Doing this would improve query time for the first table, as we need to scan less data for search queries.

# 6. Horizontal partitioning

For the remainder of this video, let's focus on the second type of partitioning: horizontal partitioning. Instead of splitting tables up over the columns, you can also split up tables over the rows. For example, you could split up data according to a timestamp. Specifically, all records related to 2019 could be in a separate partition from the ones of 2018.

# 7. Horizontal partitioning: an example

Let's look at an example. Let's say you have the following table where every row is a book sale. We could decide to partition the table according to the timestamp.

# 8. Horizontal partitioning: an example

You could create partitions according to the timestamp, and partition them by quarter. Different SQL dialects have different ways of creating partitioned tables. In this example, we'll look at PostgreSQL, where you can use something called declarative partitioning since PostgreSQL 10. First, you add the PARTITION BY clause to your table creation statement. You pass it the column you want to partition by, 'timestamp' in our case. Next, you have to create the partitions. To do this, use the PARTITION OF clause to create tables for the specific partitions. You can specify rules to partition by in the same statement. For a timestamp, you could use particular ranges of values, like this. Finally, it's advised to add an index to the column you used for partitioning.

# 9. Pros/cons of horizontal partitioning

Horizontal partitioning can help by optimizing indices, increasing the chance heavily-used parts of the index fit in memory. You could also move rarely accessed partitions to a slower medium. Both OLAP as OLTP can benefit from partitioning. There are some downsides though, as partitioning an existing table can be a hassle: you have to create a new table and copy over the data. Additionally, we can not always set the same type of constraints on a partitioned table, for example, the PRIMARY KEY constraint.

# 10. Relation to sharding

We can take partitioning one step further and distribute the partitions over several machines. When horizontal partitioning is applied to spread a table over several machines, it's called sharding. You can see how this relates to massively parallel processing databases, where each node, or machine, can do calculations on specific shards.

# 11. Let's practice!

Let's practice!

# Reasons to partition

In the video, you saw some very good reasons to use partitioning. However, can you find which one wouldn't be a good reason to use partitioning?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/30a9bdd5-77ed-4bc7-bcdd-433932693edc)

That's not something you'd use partitioning for.

# Partitioning and normalization

In the video, you saw the differences between the two types of partitioning: vertical and horizontal partitioning. As you'd expect, the names suggest how these different strategies work.

It might be a bit challenging to distinguish normalization, which you saw in previous chapters, from partitioning.

Can you classify the characteristics in the correct bucket?

Partitioning is related to the physical data model. It does not change the logical data model, while normalization does.

# Creating vertical partitions

In the video, you learned about vertical partitioning and saw an example.

For vertical partitioning, there is no specific syntax in PostgreSQL. You have to create a new table with particular columns and copy the data there. Afterward, you can drop the columns you want in the separate partition. If you need to access the full table, you can do so by using a JOIN clause.

In this exercise and the next one, you'll be working with the example database called pagila. It's a database that is often used to showcase PostgreSQL features. The database contains several tables. We'll be working with the film table. In this exercise, we'll use the following columns:

film_id: the unique identifier of the film
long_description: a lengthy description of the film

1. Create a new table film_descriptions containing 2 fields: film_id, which is of type INT, and long_description, which is of type TEXT.
Occupy the new table with values from the film table.

```
-- Create a new table called film_descriptions
CREATE TABLE film_descriptions (
    film_id INT,
    long_description TEXT
);

-- Copy the descriptions from the film table
INSERT INTO film_descriptions
SELECT film_id, long_description FROM film;
```

2. Drop the field long_description from the film table.
Join the two resulting tables to view the original table.

```
-- Create a new table called film_descriptions
CREATE TABLE film_descriptions (
    film_id INT,
    long_description TEXT
);

-- Copy the descriptions from the film table
INSERT INTO film_descriptions
SELECT film_id, long_description FROM film;
    
-- Drop the descriptions from the original table
ALTER TABLE film
DROP COLUMN long_description;

-- Join to view the original table
SELECT * FROM film
JOIN film_descriptions USING(film_id);
```

Now you know how to CREATE, INSERT and ALTER statements!

# Creating horizontal partitions

In the video, you also learned about horizontal partitioning.

The example of horizontal partitioning showed the syntax necessary to create horizontal partitions in PostgreSQL. If you need a reminder, you can have a look at the slides.

In this exercise, however, you'll be using a list partition instead of a range partition. For list partitions, you form partitions by checking whether the partition key is in a list of values or not.

To do this, we partition by LIST instead of RANGE. When creating the partitions, you should check if the values are IN a list of values.

We'll be using the following columns in this exercise:

film_id: the unique identifier of the film
title: the title of the film
release_year: the year it's released

1. Create the table film_partitioned, partitioned on the field release_year.

```
-- Create a new table called film_partitioned
CREATE TABLE film_partitioned (
  film_id INT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  release_year TEXT
)
PARTITION BY LIST (release_year);
```

2. Create three partitions: one for each release year: 2017, 2018, and 2019. Call the partition for 2019 film_2019, etc.

```
-- Create a new table called film_partitioned
CREATE TABLE film_partitioned (
  film_id INT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  release_year TEXT
)
PARTITION BY LIST (release_year);

-- Create the partitions for 2019, 2018, and 2017
CREATE TABLE film_2019
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2019');
    
CREATE TABLE film_2018
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2018');
    
CREATE TABLE film_2017
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2017');
```

3. Occupy the new table, film_partitioned, with the three fields required from the film table.

```
-- Create a new table called film_partitioned
CREATE TABLE film_partitioned (
  film_id INT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  release_year TEXT
)
PARTITION BY LIST (release_year);

-- Create the partitions for 2019, 2018, and 2017
CREATE TABLE film_2019
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2019');

CREATE TABLE film_2018
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2018');

CREATE TABLE film_2017
	PARTITION OF film_partitioned FOR VALUES IN ('2017');

-- Insert the data into film_partitioned
INSERT INTO film_partitioned
SELECT film_id, title, release_year FROM film;

-- View film_partitioned
SELECT * FROM film_partitioned;
```

As you can see, the data is not changed in the partitioned table. However, you might notice PostgreSQL orders the partitioned table differently by default.
