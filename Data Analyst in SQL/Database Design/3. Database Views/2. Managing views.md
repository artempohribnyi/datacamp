# 1. Managing views

Welcome back! Now that we've got a grasp on what views are, let's dig deeper.

# 2. Creating more complex views

We've kept our views simple. It's worth pointing out that views can get as complicated and creative as you choose. Think of the aggregation, join, and conditional functions and clauses available to you in SQL. Of course, the query to create the view still has to run, so you need to be aware of long query execution time.

# 3. Granting and revoking access to a view

In the last video, we talked about how views are helpful for access control. To give and remove user permissions, we use the SQL GRANT and REVOKE command. The syntax is as follows. First, you list the relevant privileges after the GRANT and the REVOKE command. There are several types of privileges users can execute, and here I list the most common. Then you indicate on which object and for which role. You use the TO clause and FROM clause, respectively, for grant and revoke. In chapter 4, we'll go more in-depth about different types of roles and privileges. For now, we just need a high-level understanding.

# 4. Granting and revoking example

Here's an example. The update privilege on an object called ratings is being granted to public. PUBLIC is a SQL term that encompasses all users. All users can now use the UPDATE command on the ratings object. In the second line, the user db_user will no longer be able to INSERT on the object films.

# 5. Updating a view

A user can update a view if they have the necessary privilege. If you need a refresher, here's a simple example of the UPDATE command. You may be wondering, how is it even possible to update a view? That's a good question because if you remember correctly, a view isn't a physical table. Therefore, when you run an update, you are updating the tables behind the view. Hence, only particular views are updatable. There are criteria for a view to be considered updatable. The criteria depend on the type of SQL being used. Generally, the view needs to be made up of one table and can't rely on a window or aggregate function.

# 6. Inserting into a view

The INSERT command is in a similar case as the UPDATE command. When you run an insert command into a view, you're again really inserting into the table behind it. The criteria for inserting is usually very similar to updatable views.

# 7. Inserting into a view

Generally, avoid modifying data through views. It's usually a good idea to use views for read-only purposes only.

# 8. Dropping a view

Dropping a view is straightforward with the DROP command. There are two useful parameters to know about: CASCADE and RESTRICT. Sometimes there are SQL objects that depend on views. For example, it's not unusual for views to build off of other views in larger databases. The RESTRICT parameter is the default and returns an error when you try to drop a view that other objects depend on. The CASCADE parameter will drop the view and any object that depends on that view.

# 9. Redefining a view

Say you want to change the query a view is defined by. To do this, you can use the CREATE OR REPLACE command. If a view_name exists, it is replaced by the new_query specified. However, there are limitations to this. The new query must generate the same column names, column order, and column data types as the existing query. The column output may be different, as long as those conditions are met. New columns may be added at the end. If this criteria can't be met, the solution is to drop the existing view and create a new one.

# 10. Altering a view

Last but not least, the auxiliary properties of a view can be altered. I list the various options here. This includes changing the name, owner, and schema of a view.

# 11. Let's practice!

Ok, let's see what you've learned!

# Creating a view from other views

Views can be created from queries that include other views. This is useful when you have a complex schema, potentially due to normalization, because it helps reduce the JOINS needed. The biggest concern is keeping track of dependencies, specifically how any modifying or dropping of a view may affect other views.

In the next few exercises, we'll continue using the Pitchfork reviews data. There are two views of interest in this exercise. top_15_2017 holds the top 15 highest scored reviews published in 2017 with columns reviewid,title, and score. artist_title returns a list of all reviewed titles and their respective artists with columns reviewid, title, and artist. From these views, we want to create a new view that gets the highest scoring artists of 2017.

1. Create a view called top_artists_2017 with artist from artist_title.
To only return the highest scoring artists of 2017, join the views top_15_2017 and artist_title on reviewid.
Output top_artists_2017.

```
-- Create a view with the top artists in 2017
CREATE VIEW top_artists_2017 AS
-- with only one column holding the artist field
SELECT artist_title.artist FROM artist_title
INNER JOIN top_15_2017
ON artist_title.reviewid = top_15_2017.reviewid;

-- Output the new view
SELECT * FROM top_artists_2017;
```

Question

2. Which is the DROP command that would drop both top_15_2017 and top_artists_2017?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/63802349-e1a5-4dec-8b29-824bd0be7f18)

Because top_artists_2017 depends on top_15_2017, the CASCADE parameter indicates both should be dropped.

# Granting and revoking access

Access control is a key aspect of database management. Not all database users have the same needs and goals, from analysts, clerks, data scientists, to data engineers. As a general rule of thumb, write access should never be the default and only be given when necessary.

In the case of our Pitchfork reviews, we don't want all database users to be able to write into the long_reviews view. Instead, the editor should be the only user able to edit this view.

Revoke all database users' update and insert privileges on the long_reviews view.
Grant the editor user update and insert privileges on the long_reviews view.

```
-- Revoke everyone's update and insert privileges
REVOKE UPDATE, INSERT ON long_reviews FROM PUBLIC; 

-- Grant the editor update and insert privileges 
GRANT UPDATE, INSERT ON long_reviews TO editor; 
```

The editor user is now the only person who can UPDATE and INSERT on the long_reviews view.

# Updatable views

In a previous exercise, we've used the information_schema.views to get all the views in a database. If you take a closer look at this table, you will notice a column that indicates whether the view is updatable.

Which views are updatable?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/b363e858-4093-470f-b91c-6bb5dff95621)

```
-- Get all non-systems views
SELECT * FROM information_schema.views
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/73c8b62f-72a5-4b37-aa6c-af14661ab3df)

`long_reviews` is updatable because it's made from one table and doesn't have any special clauses.

# Redefining a view

Unlike inserting and updating, redefining a view doesn't mean modifying the actual data a view holds. Rather, it means modifying the underlying query that makes the view. In the last video, we learned of two ways to redefine a view: (1) CREATE OR REPLACE and (2) DROP then CREATE. CREATE OR REPLACE can only be used under certain conditions.

The artist_title view needs to be appended to include a column for the label field from the labels table.

Question

1. Can the CREATE OR REPLACE statement be used to redefine the artist_title view?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/147e25ef-47e7-42b3-84ac-25ac56ac44e7)

2. Use CREATE OR REPLACE to redefine the artist_title view.
Respecting artist_title's original columns of reviewid, title, and artist, add a label column from the labels table.
Join the labels table using the reviewid field.

```
-- Redefine the artist_title view to have a label column
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW artist_title AS
SELECT reviews.reviewid, reviews.title, artists.artist, labels.label
FROM reviews
INNER JOIN artists
ON artists.reviewid = reviews.reviewid
INNER JOIN labels
ON reviews.reviewid = labels.reviewid;

SELECT * FROM artist_title;
```

You redefined the artist_title succesfully using the CREATE OR REPLACE statement. If we had wanted to change the order of the columns completely, we would have had to drop the table and then create a new one using the same name.
