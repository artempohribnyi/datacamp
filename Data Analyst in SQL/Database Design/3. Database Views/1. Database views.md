Get ready to work with views! In this chapter, you will learn how to create and query views. On top of that, you'll master more advanced capabilities to manage them and end by identifying the difference between materialized and non-materialized views.

# 1. Database views

In this chapter, we'll learn about database views.

# 2. Database views

So, what are views? Wikipedia provides the following definition. Pause to read it. Essentially, views are virtual tables that are not part of the physical schema. A view isn't stored in physical memory; instead, the query to create the view is. The data in a view comes from data in tables of the same database. Once a view is created, you can query it like a regular table. The benefit of a view is that you don't need to retype common queries. It allows you to add virtual tables without altering the database's schema.

# 3. Creating a view (syntax)

Views are simple to create. You take the query of interest and add a line before it to name the view, as such.

# 4. Creating a view (example)

Here's an example. This is part of last chapter's snowflake schema. Let's say analysts at your company are often running analytics on the science fiction genre. To help their workflow, you want to create a view specifically dedicated to the science fiction genre and its associated book titles and authors.

# 5. Creating a view (example)

The query would look something like this. To convert this query into a view, you would add a CREATE VIEW statement like so.

# 6. Querying a view (example)

After executing the code from the last slide, you can query the view.

# 7. Behind the scenes

scifi_books isn't a real table with physical memory. When we run this select statement, the following query is actually being run.

# 8. Viewing views

It's important to keep track of the views in your database. To get all the views in your database, you can run a query on the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.views table. Note that this command is specific to PostgreSQL. If you are using another DBMS, look at its documentation to find the equivalent command. If you run this command, you will get a long list of views. That's because DBMS's have their own built-in views. To exclude system views and to get to views you've created, use this query. It excludes views from pg_catalog and information_schema which are built-in view categories.

# 9. Benefits of views

Can you see why views are useful? First off, a view doesn't take up any storage except for the query statement, which is minimal. Views act as a form of access control. For example, instead of giving a user access to columns that may have sensitive information, you can restrict what they can see via a view. Perhaps most importantly, views mask the complexity of queries. Remember those snowflake schemas from the last chapter and their joins? Views are handy for views normalized past the 2NF. You can make those common joins - such as aggregating dates or genres - into views. The users of your database will thank you for views because they won't have to spend as much time thinking about how to join tables.

# 10. Exercises

In this chapter's exercises, we'll be using a database of Pitchfork reviews from Kaggle. Pitchfork is a music magazine that publishes reviews. The database schema looks like this. The main table Reviews holds the url of the review, the title of the work being reviewed, and the score it received. It has more information on the author of the review and date of publication. The reviewid field is a foreign key to tables: content, genres, artist, and labels. Content holds the text of the review.

# 11. Let's practice!

Ok now we're ready, let's get to some exercises!

# Tables vs. views

Views have been described as "virtual tables". It's true that views are similar to tables in certain aspects, but there are key differences. In this exercise, you will organize these differences and similarities.

Organize these characteristics into the category that they describe best.

It looks like you got the hang of tables and views. These characteristics can help make decisions about what needs to be a table or view.

# Viewing views

Because views are very useful, it's common to end up with many of them in your database. It's important to keep track of them so that database users know what is available to them.

The goal of this exercise is to get familiar with viewing views within a database and interpreting their purpose. This is a skill needed when writing database documentation or organizing views.

1. Query the information schema to get views.
Exclude system views in the results.

```
-- Get all non-systems views
SELECT * FROM information_schema.views
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');
```

Question

2. What does view1 do?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/15668a3a-c8dc-43fc-8b19-971e16a32bd8)

```
SELECT content.reviewid,
    content.content
   FROM content
  WHERE (length(content.content) > 4000);
```

Question

3. What does view2 do?

```
SELECT reviews.reviewid,
    reviews.title,
    reviews.score
   FROM reviews
  WHERE (reviews.pub_year = 2017)
  ORDER BY reviews.score DESC
 LIMIT 10;
```

Did view1 and view2 give you more ideas of how views can be used? Note that unlike this exercise, you should always give views descriptive names for views!
