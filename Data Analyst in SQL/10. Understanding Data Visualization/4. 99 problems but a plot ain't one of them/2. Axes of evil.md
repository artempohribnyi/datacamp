# 1. Axes of evil

Let's take a look at problems with axes in plots.

# 2. Nonsense bar lengths

One thing that is fundamental to bar plots is that the length of each bar is proportional to whatever value it represents. In this infographic found on the wonderful subreddit, "dataisugly", the 22-point-5 percent scored by Yang in the poll appears to be much larger than the 21 percent scored by Sanders, or "Bernie", as he is affectionately referred to here. If we draw the bar plot correctly, you can see that the difference between the two poll scores is fairly small. I don't want to single out Yang specifically, but I would like to warn you to be cautious when interpreting plots on political posters.

# 3. The same applies to stacked bar plots

It isn't just politicians who play fast and loose with the rules of data visualization. This time we have a stacked bar plot from dataisugly, about market share of phone operating systems. The problem with this is more subtle. Rather than making up bar lengths to look good on a poster, the values do match a real scale. The mistake is that the y-axis, containing market share, begins at seventy-five percent instead of zero. This makes it look like Android and iOS have similar market shares. If we draw the stacked bar plot correctly, we see that Android has a much larger share.

# 4. Dual axes are misleading

Another common bad idea for plots is to use two y-axes. This is typically done when you want to plot two things on the y-axis with very different scales. Here you can see the United Nations dataset, with length of schooling on the x-axis. The red points are related to life expectancy and link to the y-axis on the left. The blue points link to the human development index for the country and link to the y-axis on the right. The two axes are needed here because the life expectancies are all between fifty and ninety, but the human development index is on a scale from zero to one. The problem is that by changing the right-hand y-axis, the interpretation of the plot completely changes. On the left, it looks there is a strong correlation between life expectancy and human development index, but on the right it looks like there is no correlation. You have to stare hard at the numbers on the axis to see what is going on.

# 5. Better to use multiple panels

A much better solution is to admit that you are trying to plot two different things, and keep them in separate panels, so it's clear to your audience that they are different metrics.

# 6. Let's practice!

Time to play with some axes.

# Bar plot axes

When we look at a bar plot, we use the relative lengths of each bar to help interpret what is happening. If you don't include zero on the axis used for bar lengths, then the relative lengths of bars are distorted, and it is easy to be misled.

Here is a bar plot of another question from the Health Survey for England, this time about people with asthma. ("Not asthmatic" means no asthma symptoms were reported, and no medication was taken for asthma in the previous 12 months.)

Compare version of the plot with each y-axis, and determine which statement is true.

When zero is not included in the y-axis, you have to really stare at the axis labels to know what is happening, and it is easy to be misled.

# Dual axes

One popular but terrible idea is to draw a scatter plot or line plot with two different y-axes. This typically happens when you have two metrics with different units, and different scales that you want to plot against a common x-axis. The problem is that by changing the relationship between the two axes, you can tell almost any story that you want with the data.

Here you can see the stock prices of Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) from 2017 to 2020. When you saw these in Chapter 3, each price had been adjusted to relative to the maximum for that company. That way each line was comparable. Here, the prices have been adjusted for dividends and splits but they have not been scaled relative to their maxima.

Adjust the vertical position and steepness of the slope for the AMZN line, then determine which statement is true.

It would have been better to draw each line in its own panel, like this.
