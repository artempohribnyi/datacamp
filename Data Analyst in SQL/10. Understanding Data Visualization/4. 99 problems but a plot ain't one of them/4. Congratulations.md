# 1. Congratulations

Well done! You've seen a lot of data visualizations now.

# 2. Histograms: show a distribution

In Chapter 1 you learned that histograms are excellent for showing the distribution of a continuous variable, and

# 3. Box plots: show lots of distributions

that box plots can compactly show the distributions of lots of continuous variables.

# 4. Scatter plots: compare two numeric variables

In Chapter 2 you saw that scatter plots can show the relationship between two continuous variables, and

# 5. Line plots: show trends over time

that line plots are great for showing trends over time.

# 6. Bar plots: show counts by category

You also saw that bar plots show counts or proportions split by categories, and

# 7. Dot plots: show log scale metrics by category

that dot plots will do the same, but allow for logarithmic scales and showing multiple metrics at once.

# 8. Extra dimensions

In Chapter 3, you saw that using colors or multiple panels are often the best way to add a third dimension to your plot, since 3D plots are hard to interpret.

# 9. 3 types of color scale

You also learned that there are three types of color scale: qualitative, sequential, and diverging.

# 10. Pair plot: compare many variables

For cases where you need to analyze many variables at once, you saw three types of plots. Pair plots show relationships between each pair of variables,

# 11. Correlation heatmap: show related variables

correlation heatmaps show related variables, and

# 12. Parallel coordinates plot: find patterns across variables

parallel coordinates plots show patterns across many variables.

# 13. Rose plot: show a cyclical distribution

In Chapter 4, you learned that plots with polar coordinates are usually a bad idea, but they have niche uses when data is cyclical, like a time of day.

# 14. Dual axes are bad

You also learned that using dual axes is almost always misleading, and that

# 15. Eliminate chartjunk

minimalism is a good idea. You should eliminate anything from the plot that distracts from interpretations.

# 16. Next steps

If you are interested in learning more about data visualization, you can take courses on the R package ggplot2, which was used to create the plots in this course, or on business intelligence tools like Tableau, or Python packages like matplotlib and seaborn.

# 17. You made it!

Happy learning!
