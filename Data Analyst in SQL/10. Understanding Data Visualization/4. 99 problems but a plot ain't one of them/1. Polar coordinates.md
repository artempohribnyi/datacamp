In this final chapter, you’ll learn how to identify and avoid the most common plot problems. For example, how can you avoid creating misleading or hard to interpret plots, and will your audience understand what it is you’re trying to tell them? All will be revealed! You'll explore wind directions, asthma incidence, and seats in the German Federal Council.

# 1. Polar coordinates

You've seen a lot of plot types so far, but one type has been conspicuously absent.

# 2. Pie plots

That's the pie plot. It's a wildly popular plot type, but we've been avoiding it for a good reason.

# 3. ESPN famous athletes, by sport

Here's the bar plot of famous athletes by sport.

# 4. Bar plot + polar coords = pie plot

If you convert the coordinate system for the plot from Cartesian coordinates, that is, standard x and y axes, to polar coordinates, you get a pie plot. A pie plot is just a bar plot where the bar lengths are converted to angles. Unfortunately, this plot is much harder to interpret than the bar plot. For example, it's really hard to answer questions that were easy with the bar plot, like "How many cricketers were on the list?". Data visualization research suggests that bar plots are almost always easier to interpret than pie plots.

# 5. When should you use polar coordinates?

So the answer to the question of when should you use polar coordinates is that they are almost never a good idea. There is one exception, though it is fairly niche. If you have data that has some natural circularity to it, like the time of day or a direction, then polar coordinates can be acceptable.

# 6. Histogram of animal activity

Here's a histogram of animal activity from the Panama camera trap dataset. You saw this as part of the pair plot in the previous chapter. It's a great plot with one problem: the activity from the nocturnal paca appears to be split in two, because the plot doesn't recognize that midnight on the left of the x-axis is the same as the midnight on the right of the x-axis.

# 7. Histogram + polar coords = rose plot

One possible fix is to convert the histograms to polar coordinates, forming a rose plot. This is slightly different to the pie plot because it's the x-axis that is converted to angles, and the bar heights still remain as lengths. Now if you look at the paca's activity distribution, it's clearer that it is one burst of activity lasting all night, rather than two separate bursts.

# 8. Let's practice!

Let's explore some circular plots!

# Pie plots

Pie plots (sometimes called pie charts) are extremely popular, but often difficult to interpret. They are just bar plots converted into polar coordinates, and humans are generally worse at perceiving angles accurately compared to lengths.

Following on from the scotch whisky dataset in the last chapter, here's another dataset from the Health Survey for England, this time on alcohol consumption in English men aged 16 or more. Pie segments and bar heights represent percentages of responders.

Look at the pie plot and the bar plot and determine which statement is true.

Polar coordinates are usually a bad idea. A bar plot is almost alway easier to interpret than a pie plot.

# Rose plots

One good use case for polar coordinates is when the data is naturally circular, for example, when it is a compass direction. If you plot a histogram with polar coordinates, you get a rose plot.

Here you can see a plot of wind direction data from a meteorological mast. Knowing the predominant wind direction is important for weather modeling and for determining where to site wind turbines. Wind measurements were taken at 10 minute intervals over an eight month period.

Look at the histogram and rose plot, then determine which statement is true.

For cyclical data, polar coordinates can sometimes make a plot easier to interpret.
