# 1. Dot plots

Let's look at dot plots, a close relative of bar plots.

# 2. When should you use a dot plot?

Dot plots work in the same situations as bar plots, but have two advantages. You can use a logarithmic scale with them, and you can plot multiple metrics with them.

# 3. Nearby stars and brown dwarfs

Here is a dataset on the stars nearest to Earth. The distance from Earth is measured in light years, and the mass is measured in solar masses, that is, multiples of the mass of The Sun.

# 4. Bar plot vs. dot plot

Here's a bar plot of the star masses, ordered from nearest star at the top to furthest star at the bottom. There is a huge range in bar lengths, and some of the bars are barely visible. This would look better on a logarithmic scale. Unfortunately, the logarithm of zero is minus infinity, and bars in a bar plot must always begin at zero. This means that a logarithmic scale isn't possible for a bar plot. The workaround is to display a point instead. This is called a dot plot. Here, the scale is linear, so you can see that each point lies where the top of the bar would have been.

# 5. Log scales

Using a logarithmic scale helps to answer question about how many times heavier one star is compared to another.

# 6. Sorting rows

As with bar plots, the order of the rows matters. By sorting rows from heaviest star to lightest, it's easier to answer questions about which is the heaviest or lightest star nearest to Earth.

# 7. Let's practice!

Let's get dotty!

# Interpreting dot plots

Dot plots are similar to bar plots in that they show a numeric metric for each category of a categorical variable. They have two advantages over bar plots: you can use a log scale for the metric, and you can display more than one metric per category.

Here is a dot plot of the social media followings of the ESPN 2017 top 100 famous athletes, with one row per athlete. Three metrics are shown for each athlete: the number of followers on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Only the athletes for Basketball, Cricket, Soccer, and Tennis who had accounts on each platform are shown. Rows are sorted alphabetically for each sport.

Based on the plot, which statement about the athlete's social media following is false?

Dot plots are like bar plots, but you can use log scales and show multiple metrics on each row.

# Sorting dot plots

As with box plots and bar plots, how you order the rows in a dot plot affects the kinds of questions that are easy to answer.

Here you can see the Big Mac Index: the price of a McDonalds Big Mac in various countries around the world (in Jan 2020). The "Actual price" is the price converted to US dollars. The "GDP adjusted price" has an additional correction for the gross domestic product of a country. Roughly, if people earn less in a country, it will cost more using the adjusted price.

By default, the rows in the dot plot are ordered alphabetically. This makes it really easy to look up the price for a specific country, but difficult to answer question about where the most expensive or least expensive Big Macs can be found. By sorting the rows by price, those questions are easier to answer.

Which statement is true?

Big Macs appear to be luxury cuisine in Pakistan and Nicaragua. By changing the sort order to one of the prices, questions about highest or lowest prices are much easier to answer.
