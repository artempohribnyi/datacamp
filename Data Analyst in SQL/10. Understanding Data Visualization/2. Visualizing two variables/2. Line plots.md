# 1. Line plots

A close relative to the scatter plot is the line plot.

# 2. Worldwide COVID-19 coronavirus cases

Here is a mildly terrifying scatter plot of the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 coronavirus throughout the world in early 2020. It's OK, but we can make a better plot. Since the x-axis consists of dates, consecutive data points are connected. That means that the plot is easier to understand if we connect those data points. That is, using a line is preferable to points here.

# 3. When should you use a line plot?

So the use case for line plots is the same as for scatter plots, with one extra condition: consecutive data points are connected in some way. The most common case is that the x-axis represents dates or times, like you just saw with the coronavirus cases, but that isn't always the case.

# 4. Comparing multiple lines

One really useful thing about line plots is that you can draw multiple lines on the same plot and compare them. Here you can see that in February, the majority of cases of COVID-19 were reported in China, then in March the rest of the world overtook it.


# 5. Trend lines

One useful thing to do is to compare line plots to a trend line generated from a linear regression. This plot shows the cases reported in China in March, after quarantines and other restrictions were in place. The data line closely follows the straight trend line, indicating that the number of cases is growing linearly.

# 6. Trend lines + log scale

By contrast, if we look at the cases outside of China, a linear trend is a really poor fit. The number of cases is growing much faster than that. By transforming the plot to use a logarithmic scale on the y-axis before fitting the trend line, you see a much better fit. That means that on a worldwide level, the number of cases is growing exponentially.

# 7. Time x-axis doesn't always imply line plot

Just because you have a dataset where you want to look at the relationship between a numeric variable and time, it doesn't mean a line plot is the best choice. Here you can see the results of a poll by the BBC, where critics were asked to score the best hip-hop songs. In the plot, each point represents a song. Date is on the x-axis and the critic's score is on the y-axis. Because each song is not connected to the next song, you can't draw a line between them, and a scatter plot makes more sense. To reiterate: line plots need consecutive data values to be conceptually connected.

# 8. Time x-axis doesn't always imply line plot

In case you were wondering, the top-rated hip-hop song of all time was Juicy by The Notorious BIG.

# 9. Time x-axis doesn't always imply line plot

Conversely, you don't always need dates or times on the x-axis. Here you can see a plot of juvenile offenders in Switzerland. The x-axis is time, and the y-axis is the number of offenders, and each line represents an age group. Somehow, I find this plot be be very unsatisfying for getting insights. In a later exercise, you'll see an alternative approach without a time x-axis that works better.

# 10. Let's practice!

Time to draw some line plots!

# Interpreting line plots

Line plots are excellent for comparing two continuous variables, where consecutive observations are connected somehow. A common type of line plot is to have dates or times on the x-axis, and a numeric quantity on the y-axis. In this case, "consecutive observations" means values on successive dates, like today and tomorrow. By drawing multiple lines on the same plot, you can compare values.

The following line plot shows the percentage of households in the United States that adopted each of four technologies (automobiles, refrigerators, stoves, and vacuums) from 1930 to 1970.

Categorize these statements about the line plot as true or false.

Line plots are especially good at letting you answer questions about continuous values over time.

# Logarithmic scales for line plots

If you have a dataset where the values span several orders of magnitude, it can be easier to view them on a logarithmic scale.

A subset of the COVID-19 coronavirus data is shown in the line plot. You saw in the video that most of the cases in early 2020 occurred in mainland China. You might wonder what is happening in the rest of the world. Here, the six countries with the most number of confirmed cases outside of mainland China are shown.

On the linear scale, notice that moving up one grid line in the plot adds 20000. On the logarithmic scale, moving up one grid line in the plot multiplies by 4.

Considering the six countries on the plot, which statement is true?

If your data spans many orders of magnitude, choosing a logarithmic y-axis can make it easier to distinguish between the lines.

# Line plots without dates on the x-axis

Although dates and times are the most common type of variable for the x-axis in line plot, other types of variable are possible.

In the video, you saw data on the ages of juvenile offenders in Switzerland. That data was presented with time on the x-axis and one line for each age. Since that plot wasn't very satisfactory, we'll try again. This time, age is on the x-axis and there is one line for each year. In the plot you can see two separate clusters of lines representing different age profiles for the offenders.

Which year did the change in age profile of juvenile offenders take place?

A mature solution to visualizing juvenile offenders! Line plots don't need time on the x-axis; numbers work just as well.
