# 1. Box plots

Individual histograms are great, but there is a problem if you want to draw lots of them.

# 2. You can't just color in histograms

Let's revisit the kings and queens dataset. Suppose we want to see the distribution of ages for each royal house. A naive solution might be to draw the same histogram, but using different colors for each house. Sadly, this is a horrible muddled mess.

# 3. Draw each histogram in its own panel

In many cases, the only sensible way to draw lots of histograms is to draw them in their own panel. Here you can see thirteen histograms, one for each house. This approach still has problems.

# 4. Draw each histogram in its own panel

It's quite easy to compare distributions for panels that are in the same column. You can see that monarchs from the Wessex family were typically much younger when they began ruling than those from the Windsor family, since you can look down the column and see that the Wessex distribution is to the left of Windsor's. By contrast, it's harder to compare distributions between panels that are in different columns.

# 5. Draw each histogram in its own panel

To compare the ages of monarchs in the rival York and Lancaster houses, you have to do a lot of looking back and forth and staring at numbers on the x-axis, which isn't ideal.

# 6. 1-col

You could align all the panels in a single column, but that often means running out of space. Here, the text on the plot is almost unreadable. Fortunately, box plots can solve our problems.

# 7. When should you use a box plot?

Box plots split a continuous variable - like age - by a categorical variable - like royal house - and allow us to compare the resulting distributions in a space-efficient way.

# 8. Histogram vs. box plot

Here's a comparison of the histogram you saw before with a box plot.

# 9. Histogram vs. box plot: mid-line

The line in the middle shows the median of the distribution. That is, half the monarchs started ruling before this age, and half after this age.

# 10. Histograms vs. box plot: the box

The box in the box plot extends from the lower quartile to the upper quartile. The lower quartile is the point where one quarter of the values are below it. That is, one quarter of the monarchs started ruling before this age, and three quarters after it. Likewise, the upper quartile is the age where three quarters of the monarchs started ruling below this age. The difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile is called the inter-quartile range.

# 11. Histograms vs. box plots: the whiskers

The horizontal lines, known as "whiskers", have a more complicated definition. Each bar extends to one and a half times the interquartile range, but then they are limited to reaching actual data points. The technical definition is shown in the slide, but in practice, you can think of the whiskers as extending far enough that anything outside of them is an extreme value.

# 12. Monarchs by house

As mentioned before, the power of box plots is that you can compare many distributions at once. Here, the royal houses are ordered from oldest at the top to newest at the bottom. A trend is visible: since the Plantagenets in the fourteenth century, the boxes gradually move right showing that the ages when new monarchs ascend to the throne have been increasing. Godwin and Blois appear as a single line because there was only one king from each house. The Anjou house only had three kings, and forms a box with one whisker, not two. Notice that the box plot for the house of Denmark shows a point. Points are extreme values, that is, values that are outside the range of the whiskers. Denmark's right-most outlier is Sweyn who ascended at age 53, which was exceptionally high for the 11th century.

# 13. Let's practice!

Let's draw some box plots!

# Interpreting box plots

Here are box plots of cigarette consumption per person in the USA from 1985 to 1995 (Alaska and Hawaii are not included). Each observation in the dataset is the average number of packets of cigarette smoked per person in one state in one year. Thus each box plot represents the distribution of 48 data points (because there are 48 US states included in the dataset).

Categorize these statements about the box plots as true or false.

Although each box plot contains less information than a histogram, because they are so compact to draw, it is easy to compare many distributions at once.

# Ordering box plots

How you order the box plots affects the kinds of questions that are easy to answer.

Here you can see the US cigarette consumption dataset again. This time each box plot represents the distribution of cigarette consumption over time for a given US state. Thus each box plot is formed from 11 data points representing 1985 to 1995.

By default, the box plots are ordered alphabetically by state name. This makes it really easy to look up the details for a specific state, but difficult to answer questions about where the highest or lowest consumption can be found. Sorting the rows by median cigarette consumption makes those questions easier to answer.

Inter-quartile range (IQR) measures the variation in the "middle half" of the population (from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile). That means that sorting by the IQR makes it easier to answer questions about how much variation there was among the "typical" population.

Which statement is false?

There is no single “best” way to order the box plots. Different orderings make it easier to answer different questions.
