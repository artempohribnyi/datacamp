In this chapter, you will learn about using set theory operations in SQL, with an introduction to UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT clauses. Youâ€™ll explore the predominant ways in which set theory operations differ from join operations.

# 1. Set theory for SQL Joins

Welcome back for Chapter 3! In this chapter, we explore a new way of joining data: set operations. Along the way, we'll highlight key differences between set operations and the joins we have seen so far.

# 2. Venn diagrams and set theory

SQL has three main set operations, UNION, INTERSECT and EXCEPT. The Venn diagrams shown visualize the differences between them. We can think of each circle as representing a table. The green parts represent what is included after the set operation is performed on each pair of tables.

# 3. Venn diagrams and set theory

In this lesson, we will cover UNION and UNION ALL. Let's take a closer look at how they work.

# 4. UNION diagram

In SQL, the UNION operator takes two tables as input, and returns all records from both tables. The diagram shows two tables: left and right, and performing a UNION returns all records in each table. If two records are identical, UNION only returns them once. To illustrate this, the first two records of the right table have been faded out. Our result has seven records.

# 5. UNION ALL diagram

In SQL, there is a further operator for unions called UNION ALL. In contrast to UNION, given the same two tables, UNION ALL will include duplicate records. Therefore, performing UNION ALL on this data will return nine records, whereas UNION only returned seven. No records have been faded out.

# 6. UNION and UNION ALL syntax

The syntax for performing all the set operations in this chapter is highly similar. We perform a SELECT statement on our first table, a SELECT statement on our second table, and specify a set operation (in this example, either UNION or UNION ALL) between them. Note that set operations do not require a field to join ON. This is because they do not do quite the same thing as join operations we covered in earlier chapters. Rather than comparing and merging tables on the left and right, they stack fields on top of one another.

# 7. UNION and UNION ALL syntax

For all set operations, the number of selected columns and their respective data types must be identical. For instance, we can't stack a number field on top of a character field.

# 8. UNION and UNION ALL syntax

The result will only use field names (or aliases, if used) of the first SELECT statement in the query.

# 9. To the monarchs table

We now return to our world leaders example. In this example, we use one more table from our leaders database: the monarchs table. Of course, this table is only a sample of monarchs, and not a comprehensive list of monarchs across the world.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/b1933dcd-8c3d-4277-b16a-b3d2c72ed226)

# 10. Prime ministers, meet the monarchs

We can use UNION on the monarchs and prime_ministers tables to show all the different prime ministers and monarchs in these two tables. Note that the monarch field has been aliased as 'leader'. As we have learned, the monarch and prime_minister fields will be combined under the leader field, even though we only aliased the monarch field. We'll LIMIT to the first 10 results so that they fit on our screen.

# 11. After the UNION

Our UNION returns the top 10 monarchs, prime_ministers and their corresponding countries. Does something stand out here? Recall that the monarchs for Oman and Brunei are also prime ministers. UNION only lists them once each, because they are the same person. Norway is listed twice, however, because its monarch and prime minister are different people.

# 12. UNION ALL with the leaders

This is where a UNION ALL is helpful! A UNION ALL will tell us if there are any monarchs who also act as prime ministers. The syntax for this is shown.

# 13. UNION ALL result

After UNION ALL, Brunei and Oman are now listed twice.

# 14. Let's practice!

Ready for some exercises? Let's look at some more applications of UNION compared to UNION ALL.

# UNION vs. UNION ALL

Nice work learning all about UNION and UNION ALL!

Two tables, languages and currencies, are provided. Run the queries provided in the console and select the correct answer for the multiple-choice questions in this exercise.

Question
1. What result will the following SQL query produce?
```
SELECT * 
FROM languages
UNION
SELECT * 
FROM currencies;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/73571920-45ab-4da3-84a1-b3f116fb4879)

Question
2. What result will the following SQL query produce?
```
SELECT code FROM
languages
UNION ALL
SELECT code FROM 
currencies;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/a2d9ddea-f7ef-4231-aa08-25c4ad8f5b38)

Question
3. What will the following SQL query produce?
```
SELECT code 
FROM languages
UNION
SELECT curr_id 
FROM currencies;
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/787f2fdc-4e2f-4557-97af-0d1db594f2e1)

Both queries on the left and right of the set operation must have the same data types. The names of the fields do not need to be the same, as the result will always contain field names from the left query.

# Comparing global economies

Are you ready to perform your first set operation?

In this exercise, you have two tables, economies2015 and economies2019, available to you under the tabs in the console. You'll perform a set operation to stack all records in these two tables on top of each other, excluding duplicates.

When drafting queries containing set operations, it is often helpful to write the queries on either side of the operation first, and then call the set operator. The instructions are ordered accordingly.

Begin your query by selecting all fields from economies2015.
Create a second query that selects all fields from economies2019.
Perform a set operation to combine the two queries you just created, ensuring you do not return duplicates.

```
-- Select all fields from economies2015
SELECT *
FROM economies2015    
-- Set operation
UNION
-- Select all fields from economies2019
SELECT *
FROM economies2019
ORDER BY code, year;
```

UNION can be helpful for consolidating data from multiple tables into one result, which as you have seen, can then be ordered in meaningful ways.

# Comparing two set operations

You learned in the video exercise that UNION ALL returns duplicates, whereas UNION does not. In this exercise, you will dive deeper into this, looking at cases for when UNION is appropriate compared to UNION ALL.

You will be looking at combinations of country code and year from the economies and populations tables.

1. Perform an appropriate set operation that determines all pairs of country code and year (in that order) from economies and populations, excluding duplicates.
Order by country code and year.

```
-- Query that determines all pairs of code and year from economies and populations, without duplicates
SELECT 
    code,
    year
FROM economies
UNION
SELECT 
    country_code,
    year
FROM populations
ORDER BY code, year
```

2. Amend the query to return all combinations (including duplicates) of country code and year in the economies or the populations tables.

```
SELECT code, year
FROM economies
-- Set theory clause
UNION ALL
SELECT country_code, year
FROM populations
ORDER BY code, year;
```

Nicely done! UNION returned 434 records, whereas UNION ALL returned 814. Are you able to spot the duplicates in the UNION ALL?
