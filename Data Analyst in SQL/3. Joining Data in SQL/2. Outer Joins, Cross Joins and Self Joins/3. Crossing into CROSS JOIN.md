# 1. Crossing into CROSS JOIN

Now that we've worked with INNER JOINs and three types of outer joins, we will be checking out CROSS JOIN.

# 2. CROSS JOIN diagram

CROSS JOINs are slightly different than joins we have seen previously: they create all possible combinations of two tables. Let's explore the diagram for a CROSS JOIN. In this diagram we have two tables named table1 and table2, with one field each: id1 and id2, respectively. The result of the CROSS JOIN is all nine combinations of the id values of 1, 2, and 3 in table1 with the id values of A, B, and C for table2.

# 3. CROSS JOIN syntax

Let's have a look at the syntax for CROSS JOIN. Note that the syntax is very minimal, and we do not specify ON or USING with CROSS JOIN.

# 4. Pairing prime ministers with presidents

Let's apply the SQL syntax for a CROSS JOIN to the following problem that uses our database of global leaders. Suppose that all prime ministers in Asia from our database are scheduled for individual meetings with all presidents in South America from our database, and we are journalists who wish to follow all the meetings that will happen. We can create a query that returns all these combinations using a CROSS JOIN! We use a WHERE clause to focus only on prime ministers from Asia and presidents from South America. The results of the query give us all possible pairings of the four prime ministers from Asia in the prime_ministers table, and the two presidents from South America in the presidents table.

# 5. Let's practice!

We'll now dive into some exercises. Good luck!

# Histories and languages

Well done getting to know all about CROSS JOIN! As you have learned, CROSS JOIN can be incredibly helpful when asking questions that involve looking at all possible combinations or pairings between two sets of data.

Imagine you are a researcher interested in the languages spoken in two countries: Pakistan and India. You are interested in asking:

What are the languages presently spoken in the two countries?
Given the shared history between the two countries, what languages could potentially have been spoken in either country over the course of their history?
In this exercise, we will explore how INNER JOIN and CROSS JOIN can help us answer these two questions, respectively.

1. Complete the code to perform an INNER JOIN of countries AS c with languages AS l using the code field to obtain the languages currently spoken in the two countries.

```
SELECT c.name AS country, l.name AS language
-- Inner join countries as c with languages as l on code
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN languages AS l 
USING(code)
WHERE c.code IN ('PAK','IND')
	AND l.code in ('PAK','IND');
```

2. Change your INNER JOIN to a different kind of join to look at possible combinations of languages that could have been spoken in the two countries given their history.
Observe the differences in output for both joins.

```
SELECT c.name AS country, l.name AS language
FROM countries AS c        
-- Perform a cross join to languages (alias as l)
CROSS JOIN languages AS l
WHERE c.code in ('PAK','IND')
	AND l.code in ('PAK','IND');
```

Notice that the INNER JOIN returned 25 records, whereas the CROSS JOIN returned 50 records, as it took all combinations of languages returned by the INNER JOIN for both countries. Notice that this returns duplicate records in cases where both countries speak the same language. We will learn how to deal with duplicates in subsequent lessons.

# Choosing your join

Now that you're fully equipped to use joins, try a challenge problem to test your knowledge!

You will determine the names of the five countries and their respective regions with the lowest life expectancy for the year 2010. Use your knowledge about joins, filtering, sorting and limiting to create this list!

* Complete the join of countries AS c with populations as p.

* Filter on the year 2010.

* Sort your results by life expectancy in ascending order.

* Limit the result to five countries.

```
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    region,
    life_expectancy AS life_exp
FROM countries AS c
-- Join to populations (alias as p) using an appropriate join
INNER JOIN populations AS p 
ON c.code = p.country_code
-- Filter for only results in the year 2010
WHERE year = 2010
-- Sort by life_exp
ORDER BY life_exp
-- Limit to five records
LIMIT 5;
```

Did you notice that more than one type of join can be used to return the five records in our result? All four types of joins we have learned will return the same result.
