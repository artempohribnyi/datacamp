In this closing chapter, you’ll begin by investigating semi-joins and anti-joins. Next, you'll learn how to use nested queries. Last but not least, you’ll wrap up the course with some challenges!

# 1. Subquerying with semi joins and anti joins

We've made it to the final chapter of this course! Keep up the excellent work. In this lesson, we'll return to joins one last time, with an introduction to nested SQL queries.

# 2. Calling all joins

The six joins we've worked with so far are all "additive" in that they add columns to the original "left" table. The diagram shows an INNER JOIN on the id field, showing an additional column being added to the original left table.

# 3. Additive joins

Here is some familiar INNER JOIN syntax for this join on the id field. Lets dive deeper into what it means for this join to be "additive".

# 4. Additive joins

Fields with different names are added to the result set with their original names. Fields with the same name, such as date, are added to the result set too, but notice how we now have duplicate date columns with the same name. This can be changed, however, with aliasing.

# 5. Semi join

In this lesson, we'll see ways of joining data that do not expressly use JOIN keywords and are not additive in the same way. Instead of using JOIN or set operators, we can leverage the WHERE clause to specify the records to include. We'll use the two tables, left_table and right_table, in the diagram shown. A semi join chooses records in the first table where a condition is met in the second table.

# 6. Semi join

More specifically, the semi join will return all values of left_table where values of col1 are in a column we specify, namely col2 in the right_table. Records not of interest to the semi join have been faded out.

# 7. Semi join

The final result of our semi join is records corresponding to ids 2 and 3.

# 8. Kicking off our semi join

Let's make this concrete with an example. Suppose we are interested in determining the presidents of countries that gained independence before 1800. We select the fields country, continent, and president. How do we filter this data for independence year, which is a field in the states table? We'll use a semi join!

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/464cffe0-d154-4195-8255-783a1f789190)

# 9. Building on our semi join

Before we knew anything about joins, we knew we could leverage the WHERE clause to filter data. The query that returns countries with indep_year before 1800 is shown. The query returns only Spain and Portugal from our database.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/7eb0e912-b991-4e04-9044-b88718da52e7)

# 10. Finish the semi join (an intro to subqueries)

We can use this list of countries as a filter by embedding it in a further WHERE clause. This is called a subquery! It chooses records in the first table where the country matches the list returned by our subquery. Since Spain does not have a president, only the Portuguese president is listed.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/b8da8a8f-ef5f-490a-bf52-ed8548b92d6a)

# 11. Anti join

Moving on to anti joins! The anti join chooses records in the first table where col1 does NOT find a match in col2.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/1e6baeac-7861-4c38-93ea-714a8d6f9d2a)

# 12. Anti join

The final result of our anti join is records corresponding to ids 1 and 4. Again, no new columns are added.

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/9b471a81-27fd-46d7-a3a5-20ff7ada0600)

# 13. An anti join with the presidents

How might we adapt our semi join to determine countries in the Americas founded after 1800? To change our semi join from before to after 1800, we add NOT before the IN statement. We call this an anti join! In addition, we add to our first WHERE clause to filter for continents in the Americas. The result shows presidents of countries in the Americas that gained independence after 1800. Only Chile and Uruguay are returned, not the USA, which gained independence before 1800. Note again that we are only using the few countries in our database for illustration; this is not a comprehensive list of countries in the world!

# 14. Let's practice!

Let's practice!

# Multiple WHERE clauses

You've learned about semi joins in the form of nested subqueries within the WHERE clause of the main query. In this exercise, you'll familiarize yourself with semi join syntax by thinking through and re-ordering the lines of code provided. Note that subqueries are queries in their own right, so they can have a WHERE clause of their own! This is why you see two WHERE statements here.

Your task is to construct a semi join that pulls all records from economies2019 where gross_savings in the economies2015 table were below the 2015 global average. The global average gross_savings in 2015 was 22.5, and is already pre-calculated in the lines of code provided.

Re-order the lines of code provided to find all records from economies2019 where gross_savings in economies2015 were below the 2015 global average, using code to filter the economies2019 records.

You've familiarized yourself with semi join syntax, and seen that the WHERE clause can be used in both the main query and the subquery!

# Semi join

Great job getting acquainted with semi joins and anti joins! You are now going to practice using semi joins.

Let's say you are interested in identifying languages spoken in the Middle East. The languages table contains information about languages and countries, but it does not tell you what region the countries belong to. You can build up a semi join by filtering the countries table by a particular region, and then using this to further filter the languages table.

You'll build up your semi join as you did in the video exercise, block by block, starting with a selection of countries from the countries table, and then leveraging a WHERE clause to filter the languages table by this selection.

1. Select country code as a single field from the countries table, filtering for countries in the 'Middle East' region.

```
-- Select country code for countries in the Middle East
SELECT 
    code
FROM
    countries
WHERE
    region = 'Middle East';
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/6565518b-d92b-4487-a9c1-70f7f64f064a)

2. Write a second query to SELECT the name of each unique language appearing in the languages table; do not use column aliases here.
Order the result set by name in ascending order.

```
-- Select unique language names
SELECT
    DISTINCT name
FROM languages
-- Order by the name of the language
ORDER BY name;
```

3. Create a semi join out of the two queries you've written, which filters unique languages returned in the first query for only those languages spoken in the 'Middle East'.

```
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM languages
-- Add syntax to use bracketed subquery below as a filter
WHERE code IN
    (SELECT code
    FROM countries
    WHERE region = 'Middle East')
ORDER BY name;
```

Think of all the opportunities that open up when queries become building blocks of larger queries!

# Diagnosing problems using anti join

Nice work on semi joins! The anti join is a related and powerful joining tool. It can be particularly useful for identifying whether an incorrect number of records appears in a join.

Say you are interested in identifying currencies of Oceanian countries. You have written the following INNER JOIN, which returns 15 records. Now, you want to ensure that all Oceanian countries from the countries table are included in this result. You'll do this in the first step.
```
SELECT c1.code, name, basic_unit AS currency
FROM countries AS c1
INNER JOIN currencies AS c2
ON c1.code = c2.code
WHERE c1.continent = 'Oceania';
```
If there are any Oceanian countries excluded in this INNER JOIN, you want to return the names of these countries. You'll write an anti join to this in the second step!

1. Begin by writing a query to return the code and name (in order, not aliased) for all countries in the continent of Oceania from the countries table.
Observe the number of records returned and compare this with the provided INNER JOIN, which returns 15 records.

```
-- Select code and name of countries from Oceania
SELECT code, name
FROM countries 
WHERE continent = 'Oceania';
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/cbedc7cc-f328-42f4-874c-4ed44e58e8e6)

2. Now, build on your query to complete your anti join, by adding an additional filter to return every country code that is not included in the currencies table.

```
SELECT code, name
FROM countries
WHERE continent = 'Oceania'
-- Filter for countries not included in the bracketed subquery
  AND code NOT IN
    (SELECT code
    FROM currencies);
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/f4c23488-7e4c-455d-9c2a-42c28969e5ee)

Your anti join determined which five out of 19 countries that were not included in the INNER JOIN provided. Did you notice that Tuvalu has two currencies, and therefore shows up twice in the INNER JOIN? This is why the INNER JOIN returned 15 rather than 14 results.
