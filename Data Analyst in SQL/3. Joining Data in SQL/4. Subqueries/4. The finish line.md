# 1. The finish line

Congratulations on making it to the end of the course, and well done learning so many ways to join data! Let's do a rapid round-up of everything we've learned.

# 2. Types of joins

We talked a lot about joins. In SQL, a join combines columns from one or more tables in a relational database via a lookup process. We learned about INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, and CROSS JOIN. We also learned about semi joins, anti joins, and self joins.

# 3. Set operations

We also covered a different way of joining data in SQL: set operations.

# 4. Types of basic subqueries

Lastly, we covered subquerying, which is covered in more detail in later SQL courses by DataCamp. We saw subquerying inside the SELECT, WHERE and FROM clauses.

# 5. WHERE to from here?

If you'd like to continue on your journey to becoming a SQL pro, we recommend you take the SQL course listed. If you would like to continue practicing joining data, have a look at some projects, practice exercises and competitions. Alternatively, head to Workspace to build a portfolio of your own projects!

# 6. The finish line!

Good luck on your future endeavors. Look around and you will find that table joins are all around you! Thanks for sticking with it.
