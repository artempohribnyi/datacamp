# 1. Subqueries inside WHERE and SELECT

In this lesson, we'll dive deeper into embedding queries within queries. We'll revisit subqueries within a WHERE clause, and then go on to subqueries within a SELECT statement.

# 2. Syntax for subqueries inside WHERE

The semi joins and anti joins we have seen so far involve subqueries inside WHERE. The WHERE clause is the most common place for subqueries, because filtering data is one of the most common data manipulation tasks. Let's revisit this with some generic syntax and understand the nuances of this type of subquery. Have a look at the query shown. Recall that the WHERE IN clause enables us to provide a list of values to filter on.

# 3. Syntax for subqueries inside WHERE

As we have seen in the lesson on semi joins, arguments to the IN operator are not limited to lists typed out by us. We can include a SQL subquery as an argument for the IN operator, provided the result of the subquery is of the same data type as the field we are filtering on.

# 4. Syntax for subqueries inside WHERE

The query shown will only work if some_field is of the same data type as some_numeric_field, because the result of the subquery will be a numeric field. Subqueries inside WHERE can be from the same table or from a different table, and here, the subquery is from a different table.

# 5. Subqueries inside SELECT

The second most common type of subquery is inside a SELECT clause. Say we want to count the number of monarchs listed in the monarchs table for each continent in the states table. Again, let's build up our solution, step by step. The query shown selects each of the five continents in the states table, and the result is displayed.

# 6. Subqueries inside SELECT

In earlier courses we have seen the use of GROUP BY to COUNT data by a group. However, since our monarchs data lives in a different table than the states table, this would involve a careful join before the GROUP BY. Let's look at how to do this with a subquery instead. Our subquery requires two things. First, it needs to COUNT all monarchs. Second, it needs a WHERE statement matching the continent fields in the two tables. This subquery follows the selection of DISTINCT continents, and will therefore count all monarchs within them in the SELECT statement. A subquery inside a SELECT statement like this requires an alias, like monarch_count here. Magic!

# 7. Let's practice!

Test your subquery expertise with a few exercises! See you in the next video on subqueries inside the FROM clause.

# Subquery inside WHERE

The video pointed out that subqueries inside WHERE can either be from the same table or a different table. In this exercise, you will nest a subquery from the populations table inside another query from the same table, populations. Your goal is to figure out which countries had high average life expectancies in 2015.

You can use SQL to do calculations for you. Suppose you only want records from 2015 with life_expectancy above 1.15 * avg_life_expectancy. You could use the following SQL query.
```
SELECT *
FROM populations
WHERE life_expectancy > 1.15 * avg_life_expectancy
  AND year = 2015;
```
In the first step, you'll write a query to calculate a value for avg_life_expectancy. In the second step, you will nest this calculation into another query.

1. Begin by calculating the average life expectancy from the populations table.
Filter your answer to use records from 2015 only.

```
-- Select average life_expectancy from the populations table
SELECT 
    AVG(life_expectancy)
FROM 
    populations
-- Filter for the year 2015
WHERE
    year = 2015;
```

2. The answer from your query has now been nested into another query; use this calculation to filter populations for all records where life_expectancy is 1.15 times higher than average.

```
SELECT *
FROM populations
-- Filter for only those populations where life expectancy is 1.15 times higher than average
WHERE life_expectancy > 1.15 *
  (SELECT AVG(life_expectancy)
   FROM populations
   WHERE year = 2015) 
    AND year = 2015;
```

You may recognize many of these country codes as being relatively wealthy countries, which makes sense as we might expect life expectancy to be higher in wealthier nations.

# WHERE do people live?

In this exercise, you will strengthen your knowledge of subquerying by identifying capital cities in order of largest to smallest population.

Follow the instructions below to get the urban area population for capital cities only. You'll use the countries and cities tables displayed in the console to help identify columns of interest as you build your query.

Return the name, country_code and urbanarea_pop for all capital cities (not aliased).

```
-- Select relevant fields from cities table
SELECT 
    name,
    country_code,
    urbanarea_pop
FROM cities
-- Filter using a subquery on the countries table
WHERE name IN
    (SELECT capital
    FROM countries)
ORDER BY urbanarea_pop DESC;
```

You've got plenty of practice on subqueries inside WHERE. Let's move on to subqueries inside the SELECT statement.

# Subquery inside SELECT

As explored in the video, there are often multiple ways to produce the same result in SQL. You saw that subqueries can provide an alternative to joins to obtain the same result.

In this exercise, you'll go further in exploring how some queries can be written using either a join or a subquery.

In Step 1, you'll begin with a LEFT JOIN combined with a GROUP BY to select the nine countries with the most cities appearing in the cities table, along with the counts of these cities. In Step 2, you'll write a query that returns the same result as the join, but leveraging a nested query instead.

1. Write a LEFT JOIN with countries on the left and the cities on the right, joining on country code.
In the SELECT statement of your join, include country names as country, and count the cities in each country, aliased as cities_num.
Sort by cities_num (descending), and country (ascending), limiting to the first nine records.

```
-- Find top nine countries with the most cities
SELECT
    countries.name AS country,
    COUNT(cities.name) AS cities_num
FROM
    countries
LEFT JOIN
    cities
ON countries.code = cities.country_code

-- Order by count of cities as cities_num
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY 
    cities_num DESC,
    country
LIMIT 9;
```

2. Complete the subquery to return a result equivalent to your LEFT JOIN, counting all cities in the cities table as cities_num.
Use the WHERE clause to enable the correct country codes to be matched in the cities and countries columns.

```
SELECT countries.name AS country,
-- Subquery that provides the count of cities   
  (SELECT COUNT(name) AS cities_num
   FROM cities
   WHERE country_code = countries.code) AS cities_num
FROM countries
ORDER BY cities_num DESC, country
LIMIT 9;
```

Notice how the subquery involves only one additional step in your SELECT statement, whereas the JOIN and GROUP BY are a two-step process.
