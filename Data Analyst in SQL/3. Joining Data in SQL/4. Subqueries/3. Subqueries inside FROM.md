# 1. Subqueries inside FROM

The last type of subquery we'll cover is a query inside a FROM clause. Let's dig in!

# 2. Subqueries inside FROM

Let's say we are interested in all the continents with monarchs, along with the most recent country to gain independence in that continent. A starting SQL query to pull all the most recent independence years by continent is shown. The query groups records by continent and returns the most recent independence year for each group, by using the MAX() function AS most_recent. The result set is shown. Now how do we filter this for continents with monarchs?

# 3. Focusing on records inside monarchs

We haven't seen yet that we can include multiple tables in a FROM clause by adding a comma between them. In the SQL syntax shown, we include two different tables, left_table and right_table, in our FROM clause. The diagram shown illustrates that this query returns duplicates for multiple occurrences of id when it matches in both tables. We can drop duplicates using the DISTINCT command in the query shown. Let's investigate a way to solve our problem using this trick.

# 4. Finishing off the subquery

We can nest the subquery we initially wrote into a FROM statement, so that we are selecting from both monarchs and our subquery, aliased as "sub". We also use the WHERE clause as before to identify records in both tables that match on continent. As we saw on the previous slide, because the continents from our subquery will find multiple matches in monarchs, this match will return duplicates. As before, in our SELECT statement, we use the DISTINCT command to drop duplicate continents, and select sub-dot-most_recent to get the most recent independence year for each continent. Lastly, we ORDER BY continent. Have a look at our result set. There we have it: the continents with monarchs in our database, and the most recent year of independence in those continents! That's how we include a subquery as a temporary table in our FROM clause and then SELECT from it.

# 5. Let's practice!

We are very close to the end of the course. Awesome work on making it this far! The remaining exercises are designed to be challenging as they put together many of the topics we've learned so far. Stick with it!

# Subquery inside FROM

Subqueries inside FROM can help select columns from multiple tables in a single query.

Say you are interested in determining the number of languages spoken for each country. You want to present this information alongside each country's local_name, which is a field only present in the countries table and not in the languages table. You'll use a subquery inside FROM to bring information from these two tables together!

1. Begin with a query that groups by each country code from languages, and counts the languages spoken in each country as lang_num.
In your SELECT statement, return code and lang_num (in that order).

```
-- Select code, and language count as lang_num
SELECT 
    code,
    COUNT(*) AS lang_num
FROM
    languages
GROUP BY
    code
```

2. Select local_name from countries, with the aliased lang_num from your subquery (which has been nested and aliased for you as sub).
Use WHERE to match the code field from countries and sub.

```
-- Select local_name and lang_num from appropriate tables
SELECT
  local_name,
  lang_num
FROM
  countries,
  (SELECT code, COUNT(*) AS lang_num
  FROM languages
  GROUP BY code) AS sub
-- Where codes match
WHERE
  countries.code = sub.code
ORDER BY lang_num DESC;
```

This one brought several joining concepts together! Did you notice that the top three countries in our result are located in Africa?

# Subquery challenge

You're near the finish line! Test your understanding of subquerying with a challenge problem.

Suppose you're interested in analyzing inflation and unemployment rate for certain countries in 2015. You are not interested in countries with "Republic" or "Monarchy" as their form of government, but are interested in all other forms of government, such as emirate federations, socialist states, and commonwealths.

You will use the field gov_form to filter for these two conditions, which represents a country's form of government. You can review the different entries for gov_form in the countries table.

Select country code, inflation_rate, and unemployment_rate from economies.
Filter code for the set of countries which do not contain the words "Republic" or "Monarchy" in their gov_form.

```
-- Select relevant fields
SELECT 
  code, 
  inflation_rate,
  unemployment_rate 
FROM 
  economies
WHERE year = 2015 
  AND code NOT IN
-- Subquery returning country codes filtered on gov_form
	(SELECT
    code
  FROM
    countries
  WHERE 
    gov_form LIKE '%Republic%' OR gov_form LIKE '%Monarchy%')
ORDER BY inflation_rate;
```

You found that in 2015, South Sudan (with country code SSD) had inflation above 50%! Did you also notice that this query is an anti join?

# Final challenge

You've made it to the final challenge problem! Get ready to tackle this step-by-step.

Your task is to determine the top 10 capital cities in Europe and the Americas by city_perc, a metric you'll calculate. city_perc is a percentage that calculates the "proper" population in a city as a percentage of the total population in the wider metro area, as follows:

city_proper_pop / metroarea_pop * 100

Do not use table aliasing in this exercise.

From cities, select the city name, country code, proper population, and metro area population, as well as the field city_perc, which calculates the proper population as a percentage of metro area population for each city (using the formula provided).
Filter city name with a subquery that selects capital cities from countries in 'Europe' or continents with 'America' at the end of their name.
Exclude NULL values in metroarea_pop.
Order by city_perc (descending) and return only the first 10 rows.

```
-- Select fields from cities
SELECT
    name,
    country_code,
    city_proper_pop,
    metroarea_pop,
    city_proper_pop / metroarea_pop * 100 AS city_perc
FROM 
    cities
-- Use subquery to filter city name
WHERE
 name IN (SELECT
        capital
    FROM
        countries
    WHERE
        continent LIKE 'Europe' OR continent LIKE '%America')
-- Add filter condition such that metroarea_pop does not have null values 
    AND metroarea_pop IS NOT NULL
-- Sort and limit the result
ORDER BY
    city_perc DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

You've identified that Lima has the highest percentage of people living in the city 'proper', relative to the wider metropolitan population! Nicely done getting to the top of the summit.
