# 1. Multiple joins

We've seen a few inner joins and thought about the relationships tables can have to each other. Now it's time to level up our joins by building on these ideas.

# 2. Joins on joins

A powerful feature of SQL is that multiple joins can be combined and run in a single query. Let's have a look at some syntax for multiple joins. We begin with the same INNER JOIN as before, and then chain another INNER JOIN to the result of our first INNER JOIN. Notice that we use left_table-dot-id in the last line of this example. If we want to perform the second join using the id field of right_table rather than left_table, we can replace left_table-dot-id with right_table-dot-id in the final line.

# 3. Joins on joins

Thinking back to our example of world leaders, let's say that we are interested in identifying countries of the world that have both a president and a prime minister, and want to know the year each prime minister came into office. Let's have a look at the prime_minister_terms table from our database of world leaders. It contains a prime_minister column with prime minister names as well as a pm_start column containing the start year of a prime minister's term.

# 4. What to join first?

Let's apply the new syntax we have learned to our world leaders example. We can begin as before with an INNER JOIN of the presidents and prime_ministers tables, using our aliasing skills to shorten the length of the query. Recall from our first lesson that the result set of this join was a combined table showing countries with both a prime_minister and a president.

# 5. Chaining joins

If we now join the result of our first INNER JOIN with our prime_minister_terms table on the prime_minister field, the final result will be only those countries with both prime_ministers and presidents, along with the years their prime_ministers assumed office. Notice that the prime_minister_terms table has 10 records, whereas our final result only has four records. This is because only four records from the prime_minister_terms table match the result of our first INNER JOIN.

# 6. Chaining joins

Here is a look at the final SQL query for chaining a second INNER JOIN to our first INNER JOIN. Notice that the syntax for the second join is exactly the same as for the first join, but we use prime_minister as the field to join on instead. We can continue the chain and join as many tables together as we need!

# 7. What are we joining ON?

Great work! Now let's step back from our world leaders example. One more thing to know about joins is that it isn't always the case that each value in the field being joined on corresponds to exactly one record in the joining field of the right table. In the example shown, if we join on one field as we have done before, the query will return multiple records from right_table that match with left_table on the id field.

# 8. Joining on multiple keys

We can limit the records returned by supplying an additional field to join on by adding the AND keyword to our ON clause. In this example, we join on date, a frequently used second column when joining on multiple fields. The result set now contains records that match on both id AND date.

# 9. Let's practice!

Now that we know how to chain multiple joins, as well as how to join on multiple fields, let's get some practice!

# Joining multiple tables

You've seen that the ability to combine multiple joins using a single query is a powerful feature of SQL.

Suppose you are interested in the relationship between fertility and unemployment rates. Your task in this exercise is to join tables to return the country name, year, fertility rate, and unemployment rate in a single result from the countries, populations and economies tables.

1. Perform an inner join of countries AS c (left) with populations AS p (right), on code.
Select name, year and fertility_rate.

```
-- Select relevant fields
SELECT 
    name, 
    year,
    fertility_rate
-- Inner join countries and populations, aliased, on code
FROM
    countries AS c
INNER JOIN 
    populations AS p
ON 
    c.code = p.country_code;
```

2. Chain another inner join to your query with the economies table AS e, using code.
Select name, and using table aliases, select year and unemployment_rate from economies.

```
-- Select fields
SELECT 
    name, 
    p.year, 
    fertility_rate, 
    e.year,
    unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
-- Join to economies (as e)
INNER JOIN 
    economies AS e
-- Match on country code
USING(code);
```

You may have noticed an issue with these results, though. Have a look at the results for Albania. The 2010 value for fertility_rate is also paired with the 2015 value for unemployment_rate, whereas we only want data from one year per record. You'll fix this in the next exercise!

# Checking multi-table joins

Have a look at the results for Albania from the previous query below. You can see that the 2015 fertility_rate has been paired with 2010 unemployment_rate, and vice versa.

Instead of four records, the query should return two: one for each year. The last join was performed on c.code = e.code, without also joining on year. Your task in this exercise is to fix your query by explicitly stating that both the country code and year should match!

Modify your query so that you are joining to economies on year as well as code.

```
SELECT name, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON c.code = e.code
-- Add an additional joining condition such that you are also joining on year
	AND p.year = e.year;
```

You can check that this fixed the issue by looking at the results for Albania. There are only two lines of Albania results now: one for 2010 and one for 2015.
