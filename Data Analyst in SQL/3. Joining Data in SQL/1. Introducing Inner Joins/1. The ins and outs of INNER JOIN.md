In this chapter, you’ll be introduced to the concept of joining tables and will explore all the ways you can enrich your queries using joins—beginning with inner joins.

# 1. The ins and outs of INNER JOIN

Hello, my name is Maham Faisal Khan, and I'll be your instructor on a journey through the world of SQL joins. Joining data is an essential skill which enables us to draw information from separate tables together into a single, meaningful set of results. Although this course focuses on PostgreSQL, the material here applies to multiple forms of SQL.

# 2. The ins and outs of INNER JOINs

We'll begin with INNER JOIN, which along with LEFT JOIN makes up one of the two most common joins. Two tables named "left_table" and "right_table" are shown. Matching values of "id" in both tables are shown in the same color. In both tables, the id field is the key. A key is a single column or group of columns that uniquely identifies records in a table. Both tables also have fields called left_val and right_val, which will help visualize records returned after a join.

# 3. The ins and outs of INNER JOINs

With SQL joins, you can join on a key field, or any other field. The INNER JOIN shown looks for records in both tables with the same values in the key field, id. Arrows indicate records where the id matches.

# 4. The ins and outs of INNER JOINs

In this diagram, we focus on records that match on id and fade out any records that are not of interest to our INNER JOIN.

# 5. The ins and outs of INNER JOINs

The result is records with ids 1 and 4.

# 6. The leadership database schema

Throughout this course, we'll work with a database of world leaders. Our database schema is displayed here. It contains the presidents, prime_ministers and monarchs tables, as well as the states table containing independence years, and the prime_minister_terms table, providing years the prime_ministers assumed office.

# 7. At the presidents table

Let's start querying our database by selecting all fields from the presidents table. Recall the use of the asterisk in SQL to select all fields quickly.

# 8. Meet the prime ministers

Here's a snippet of the prime_ministers table from the same database.

# 9. Prime ministers, meet the presidents

Suppose that we're interested in countries that have both a president and prime minister. In these small tables, we might notice that Egypt, Portugal, Pakistan and India appear in both tables. For larger tables though, it's not as feasible to identify these records by visual inspection. Here's where SQL joins can be helpful.

# 10. Our first INNER JOIN

The syntax for performing an INNER JOIN on our tables is shown step-by-step. It is common to begin constructing the query with the join first, and selecting fields later. After FROM, we list the left table, followed by the INNER JOIN keyword and the right table. We then specify the field to match the tables on, using the ON keyword. Here, we use the "country" field. Lastly, we add SELECT at the start of the query and choose the fields we want returned. When selecting columns that exist in both tables, such as "country" and "continent", the table-dot-column_name format must be used to avoid a SQL error. The result of our query is displayed: four countries in our database have both presidents and prime ministers.

# 11. Aliasing tables

In our INNER JOIN, we've had to type out "president" and "prime_minister" several times. Luckily, we can alias table names using the same AS keyword used to alias column names. Here, we use aliases p1 and p2 in both our SELECT and ON clauses to shorten our query.

# 12. Using USING

Before we end this lesson, let's add one more SQL shortcut to make our query even more concise. When joining on two identical column names, we can employ the USING command followed by the shared column name in parentheses. Here, since the join field is named "country" in both tables, we can use USING.

# 13. Let's practice!

Now let's practice some joining.

# Your first join

Throughout this course, you'll be working with the countries database, which contains information about the most populous world cities in the world, along with country-level economic, population, and geographic data. The database also contains information on languages spoken in each country.

You can see the different tables in this database to get a sense of what they contain by clicking on the corresponding tabs. Click through them and familiarize yourself with the fields that seem to be shared across tables before you continue with the course.

In this exercise, you'll use the cities and countries tables to build your first inner join. You'll start off by selecting all columns in step 1, performing your join in step 2, and then refining your join to choose specific columns in step 3.

1. Begin by selecting all columns from the cities table, using the SQL shortcut that selects all.

```
-- Select all columns from cities
SELECT
    *
FROM 
    cities;
```

2. Perform an inner join with the cities table on the left and the countries table on the right; do not alias tables here or in the next step.
Identify the relevant column names to join ON by inspecting the cities and countries tabs in the console.

```
SELECT * 
FROM cities
-- Inner join to countries
INNER JOIN countries
-- Match on country codes
ON cities.country_code = countries.code 
```
![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/ce29bafe-85b7-4ae5-9290-4f33ae0337c5)

3. Complete the SELECT statement to keep only the name of the city, the name of the country, and the region the country is located in (in the order specified).
Alias the name of the city AS city and the name of the country AS country.

```
-- Select name fields (with alias) and region 
SELECT 
    cities.name AS city,
    countries.name AS country,
    countries.region

FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;
```

Writing out full table names when joining tables creates a lot of extra code. In the next exercise, you'll explore how you can do more aliasing to limit the amount of writing.

# Joining with aliased tables

Recall from the video that instead of writing full table names in queries, you can use table aliasing as a shortcut. The alias can be used in other parts of your query, such as the SELECT statement!

You also learned that when you SELECT fields, a field can be ambiguous. For example, imagine two tables, apples and oranges, both containing a column called color. You need to use the syntax apples.color or oranges.color in your SELECT statement to point SQL to the correct table. Without this, you would get the following error:
```
  column reference "color" is ambiguous
```
In this exercise, you'll practice joining with aliased tables. You'll use data from both the countries and economies tables to examine the inflation rate in 2010 and 2015.

When writing joins, many SQL users prefer to write the SELECT statement after writing the join code, in case the SELECT statement requires using table aliases.

Start with your inner join in line 5; join the tables countries AS c (left) with economies (right), aliasing economies AS e.
Next, use code as your joining field in line 7; do not use the USING command here.
Lastly, select the following columns in order in line 2: code from the countries table (aliased as country_code), name, year, and inflation_rate.

```
-- Select fields with aliases
SELECT 
    c.code AS country_code,
    name,
    year,
    inflation_rate
FROM countries AS c
-- Join to economies (alias e)
INNER JOIN 
    economies AS e
-- Match on code field using table aliases
ON c.code = e.code;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/d0cbc4fc-edc4-47f4-bc88-5a3b4bd27c48)

Notice that only the code field is ambiguous, so it requires a table name or alias before it. All the other fields (name, year, and inflation_rate) do not occur in more than one table name, so do not require table names or aliasing in the SELECT statement. Using table aliases takes some getting used to, but it will save you a lot of typing, especially when your query involves joining tables!

# USING in action

In the previous exercises, you performed your joins using the ON keyword. Recall that when both the field names being joined on are the same, you can take advantage of the USING clause.

You'll now explore the languages table from our database. Which languages are official languages, and which ones are unofficial?

You'll employ USING to simplify your query as you explore this question.

Use the country code field to complete the INNER JOIN with USING; do not change any alias names.

```
SELECT c.name AS country, l.name AS language, official
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN languages AS l
-- Match using the code column
USING(code);
```

It looks like Afghanistan has multiple official and unofficial languages! A parting word of caution when using USING: columns can sometimes have the same name but actually contain vastly different data. Always remember to check what you are joining on by displaying and viewing your data first!
