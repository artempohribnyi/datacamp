# 1. Writing queries

It's time to level up on our SQL queries by learning a few more commonly used keywords. Let's dive in.

# 2. Aliasing

Sometimes it can be helpful to rename columns in our result set, whether for clarity or brevity. We can do this using aliasing. Perhaps we'd like to select the name and hire year for each record in the employees table. We could alias the name column as first_name in the query by adding the AS keyword to indicate an alias of first_name after selecting the name field. The result set now has first_name rather than name as the column header. The alias only applies to the result of this particular query; in other words, the field name in the employees table itself is still name rather than first_name.

# 3. Selecting distinct records

Some SQL questions require a way to return a list of unique values. Let's imagine that we are interested in getting a list of years in which we hired our current employees. If we select the year_hired field from the employees table, the result set shows several years listed twice, which isn't what we are looking for. To get a list of years with no repeat values, we can add the DISTINCT keyword before the year_hired field name in the SELECT statement. Now, we can see that all of our employees were hired in just four different years.

# 4. DISTINCT with multiple fields

It's possible to return the unique combinations of multiple field values by listing multiple fields after the DISTINCT keyword. Take a look at the employees table. Perhaps we'd like to know the years that different departments hired employees. We could use this SQL query to look at this information, selecting the dept_id and year_hired from the employees table. Looking at the results, we see that department three hired two employees in 2021.

# 5. DISTINCT with multiple fields

To avoid repeating this information, we could add the DISTINCT keyword before the fields to select. Notice that the department id and year_hired fields still have repeat values individually, but none of the records are the same: they are all unique combinations of the two fields.

# 6. Views

Finally, let's discuss saving SQL result sets. In SQL, a view refers to a table that is the result of a saved SQL SELECT statement. Views are considered virtual tables, which means that the data a view contains is not generally stored in the database. Rather, it is the query code that is stored for future use. A benefit of this is that whenever the view is accessed, it automatically updates the query results to account for any updates to the underlying database. To create a view, we'll add a line of code before the SELECT statement: CREATE VIEW, then the name we'd like for the new view, then the AS keyword to assign the results of the query to the new view name. Here, we create a view called employee_hire_years by assigning the results of a query selecting three fields from the employees table to a new view. There is no result set when creating a view.

# 7. Using views

Once a view is created, however, we can query it just as we would a normal table by selecting FROM the view.

# 8. Let's practice!

Time to practice refining and saving queries with these new keywords!

# Making queries DISTINCT

You've learned that the DISTINCT keyword can be used to return unique values in a field. In this exercise, you'll use this understanding to find out more about the books table!

There are 350 books in the books table, representing all of the books that our local library has available for checkout. But how many different authors are represented in these 350 books? The answer is surely less than 350. For example, J.K. Rowling wrote all seven Harry Potter books, so if our library has all Harry Potter books, seven books will be written by J.K Rowling. There are likely many more repeat authors!

1. Write SQL code that returns a result set with just one column listing the unique authors in the books table.

```
-- Select unique authors from the books table
SELECT 
    DISTINCT author 
FROM 
    books
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/dfc4dfad-0b7b-421f-908a-5394807497bc)

2. Update the code to return the unique author and genre combinations in the books table.

```
-- Select unique authors and genre combinations from the books table
SELECT 
    DISTINCT author,
    genre
FROM books;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/3f9c3f64-0d2f-4dfa-a1de-d3f13200279c)

You've passed this exercise with DISTINCTion! Notice that you found 247 unique authors in the books table overall but 249 unique combinations of authors and genres. This means there are one or two authors who have written books in multiple genres!

# Aliasing

While the default column names in a SQL result set come from the fields they are created from, you've learned that aliasing can be used to rename these result set columns. This can be helpful for clarifying the intent or contents of the column.

Your task in this exercise is to incorporate an alias into one of the SQL queries that you worked with in the previous exercise!

Add an alias to the SQL query to rename the author column to unique_author in the result set.

```
-- Alias author so that it becomes unique_author
SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author
FROM books;
```

It's AS easy AS that! Great work. The alias you just implemented makes it clear that only unique authors are listed in the results and that there are no duplicates. This is clear even to someone who is reading only the result set and does not know the SQL code behind the

# VIEWing your query

You've worked hard to create the below SQL query:
```
SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author
FROM books;
```
What if you'd like to be able to refer to it later, or allow others to access and use the results? The best way to do this is by creating a view. Recall that a view is a virtual table: it's very similar to a real table, but rather than the data itself being stored, the query code is stored for later use.

1. Add a single line of code that saves the results of the written query as a view called library_authors.

```
-- Save the results of this query as a view called library_authors
CREATE VIEW library_authors AS
SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author
FROM books;
```

2. Check that the view was created by selecting all columns from library_authors.

```
-- Your code to create the view:
CREATE VIEW library_authors AS
SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author
FROM books;

-- Select all columns from library_authors
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    library_authors
```

As your SQL queries become long and complex, you'll want to be able to save your queries for referencing later. Views can also be useful when the information contained in a database table isn't quite what you need. You can create your own custom view with exactly the information you are looking for, without needing to edit the database itself, which you may not have permission to do. Creating views is a valuable skill to have, and you've mastered it!
