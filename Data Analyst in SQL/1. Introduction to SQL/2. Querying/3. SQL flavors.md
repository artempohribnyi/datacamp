# 1. SQL flavors

Our last topic in this short course is SQL flavors.

# 2. SQL flavors

SQL has a few different versions, or flavors. Some are free, while others have customer support and are made to complement major databases such as Microsoft's SQL Server or Oracle Database, which are used by many companies. All SQL flavors are used with table-based relational databases like the ones we've seen, and the vast majority of keywords are shared between them! In fact, all SQL flavors must follow universal standards set by the International Organization for Standards and the American National Standards Institute. Only additional features on top of these standards result in different SQL flavors.

# 3. Two popular SQL flavors

Let's take a look at two of the most popular SQL flavors. PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database system which was originally created at the University of California, Berkeley, and was sponsored by America's famous Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. DARPA also sponsored research leading to creating the internet, the computer mouse, and GPS! The name "PostgreSQL" is used to refer to both the database system itself as well as the SQL flavor used with it. SQL Server is also a relational database system which comes in both free and enterprise versions. It was created by Microsoft, so it pairs well with other Microsoft products. T-SQL is Microsoft's proprietary flavor of SQL, used with SQL Server databases.

# 4. Comparing PostgreSQL and SQL Server

Think of SQL flavors as dialects of the same language. If Claudia speaks American English, she will have no trouble understanding people on a trip to London, even though most people in London speak British English and there are some small differences. Here's an example of a small difference between SQL Server and PostgreSQL: when we want to limit the number of records returned, we use the LIMIT keyword in PostgreSQL. Here, we limit the number of employee names and ids selected to only the first two records. The exact same results are achieved in SQL Server using the TOP keyword instead of LIMIT. Notice that this keyword is the only difference between the two queries! Limiting results is useful when testing code, since many result sets can have thousands of results! It's best to write and test code using just a few results before removing the LIMIT for the final query.

# 5. Choosing a flavor

New SQL learners may wonder which flavor they should learn. This may be an easy decision if a learner knows that her employer uses Microsoft's SQL Server, for example. Or it might be a hard one for a job seeker or student who doesn't know what database management system a future employer might use. Don't worry too much about what flavor to learn. As we've seen, the differences are small. A PostgreSQL wizard can become a SQL Server wizard by learning a handful of different keywords!

# 6. Let's practice!

Now that we've sampled a few SQL flavors, let's practice!

# Comparing flavors

The video introduced several differences between SQL Server and PostgreSQL. These are just two of many relational database systems available, but the differences are fairly representative of the types of differences you'll see between other SQL database systems and flavors as well.

Drag the statement to the database management system that it correctly describes.

Both SQL Server and PostgreSQL are very popular SQL flavors. As your SQL journey continues, you're sure to see their names pop up!

# Limiting results

Let's take a look at a few of the genres represented in our library's books.

Recall that limiting results is useful when testing code since result sets can have thousands of results! Queries are often written with a LIMIT of just a few records to test out code before selecting thousands of results from the database.

Let's practice with LIMIT!

Using PostgreSQL, select the genre field from the books table; limit the number of results to 10.

```
-- Select the first 10 genres from books using PostgreSQL
SELECT 
    genre 
FROM 
    books
LIMIT 10
```

You can see from this exercise how it's nice to work with small result sets by limiting the number of results.

# Translating between flavors

In the previous exercise, you wrote the following code using PostgreSQL:
```
SELECT genre
FROM books
LIMIT 10;
```
The database in this course is a PostgreSQL database, so you won't be able to run SQL Server code in any of the exercises. What if you did want to update the above query to work with SQL Server, though? How would you do that?

Only a few keyword differences exist between PostgreSQL and SQL Serverâ€”most syntax is the same!
