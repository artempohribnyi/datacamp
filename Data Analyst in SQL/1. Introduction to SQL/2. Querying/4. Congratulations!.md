# 5. Where to go next

From here, it's only a matter of learning more keywords before you're writing complex SQL queries! As we discussed, the keywords you learned in this course are shared between SQL flavors, and that is true of most keywords. However, given the small differences between flavors, the next course you take will be specific to a SQL flavor. Here are a few DataCamp courses that you may want to take next.
