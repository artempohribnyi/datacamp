Learn how to manipulate string and text data by transforming case, parsing and truncating text and extracting substrings from larger strings.

# 1. Reformatting string and character data

Great job! Understanding how to manipulate and transform date and time data types will be something you use often in your data science work. Next we are going to learn how to manipulate and transform string and character data.

# 2. Topics

In this chapter we will begin by learning about functions and operators that allow us to reformat string and character data. Next you'll explore functions that allow you to parse string and character data. You will then learn how to calculate the length of a string or determine the position of a character within a string. And finally you'll learn how to truncate and pad string data. Let's get started.

# 3. The string concatenation operator

First we will look at one of the most common and frequently used techniques when working with string data. String concatenation allows you to merge two or more strings together to form a single combined string. In this example, you see how we can combine two separate columns from the customer table, first_name and last_name, to create a new column called full_name. This is one of many real world scenarios that will require you to concatenate strings.

# 4. String concatenation with functions

Additionally, PostgreSQL also has a built-in function for string concatenation. The CONCAT() function accepts one or more parameters and returns the concatenated string as the result. Each parameter can be a column from a database or a literal value separate by a comma. In this example, we see how we can perform the same concatenation operation using this function rather than the || operator from the previous slide and it will produce an identical result.

# 5. String concatenation with a non-string input

PostgreSQL also allows you to concatenate both string and non-string data. As we see in this example, we prepend the customer_id column to the first_name and last_name columns. Non-string data can be used in concatenation with both the || operator as well as the CONCAT() function.

# 6. Changing the case of string

There will also be times when you want to reformat string data to uppercase, lowercase or title case. This comes in handy when you want to standardize a field in your dataset for manipulation. The UPPER function allows you to reformat a string so you change every character to its uppercase equivalent. UPPER accepts a string as a parameter and returns that string in all uppercase. Transforming string data will be useful when normalizing and cleansing datasets.

# 7. Changing the case of string

The LOWER function is analogous to UPPER but converts the string to lowercase instead. Here you see an example with the title column from the film table.

# 8. Changing the case of string

Similarly, the INITCAP function will convert a string to title case.

# 9. Replacing characters in a string

The REPLACE function will find a substring in a string and replace it with a different substring. Look at the results of the following query. You'll notice that the phrase "A Astounding" that is present in the first few rows is grammatically incorrect.

# 10. Replacing characters in a string

So let's say we want to fix this and replace all occurrences of 'A Astounding' with the proper 'An Astounding' text. We can use the REPLACE function to accomplish this task. The function takes three parameters. The first is the source string that you want to manipulate, the second is the substring you want to find in the source string and the last parameter is the replacement string.

# 11. Manipulating string data with REVERSE

The REVERSE function does just what you think it does...it accepts a string as its only parameter and returns the same string in reverse order as you see when we use the function to reverse the title column of the film table.

# 12. Let's practice!

Now it's your turn! Let's get some practice using these functions.

# Concatenating strings

In this exercise and the ones that follow, we are going to derive new fields from columns within the customer and film tables of the DVD rental database.

We'll start with the customer table and create a query to return the customers name and email address formatted such that we could use it as a "To" field in an email script or program. This format will look like the following:

In the first step of the exercise, use the || operator to do the string concatenation and in the second step, use the CONCAT() functions.

1. Concatenate the first_name and last_name columns separated by a single space followed by email surrounded by < and >.

```
-- Concatenate the first_name and last_name and email 
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name || ' <' || email || '>' AS full_email 
FROM customer
```

2. Now use the CONCAT() function to do the same operation as the previous step.

```
-- Concatenate the first_name and last_name and email
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name,  ' <', email, '>') AS full_email 
FROM customer
```

String concatenation is an important skill that you will use often.

# Changing the case of string data

Now you are going to use the film and category tables to create a new field called film_category by concatenating the category name with the film's title. You will also format the result using functions you learned about in the video to transform the case of the fields you are selecting in the query; for example, the INITCAP() function which converts a string to title case.

Convert the film category name to uppercase.
Convert the first letter of each word in the film's title to upper case.
Concatenate the converted category name and film title separated by a colon.
Convert the description column to lowercase.

```
SELECT 
  -- Concatenate the category name to coverted to uppercase
  -- to the film title converted to title case
  UPPER(c.name)  || ': ' || INITCAP(f.title) AS film_category, 
  -- Convert the description column to lowercase
  LOWER(f.description) AS description
FROM 
  film AS f 
  INNER JOIN film_category AS fc 
  	ON f.film_id = fc.film_id 
  INNER JOIN category AS c 
  	ON fc.category_id = c.category_id;
```

Transforming strings comes in handy when preparing data for analysis.

# Replacing string data

Sometimes you will need to make sure that the data you are extracting does not contain any whitespace. There are many different approaches you can take to cleanse and prepare your data for these situations. A common technique is to replace any whitespace with an underscore.

In this example, we are going to practice finding and replacing whitespace characters in the title column of the film table using the REPLACE() function.

Replace all whitespace with an underscore.

```
SELECT 
  -- Replace whitespace in the film title with an underscore
  REPLACE(title, ' ', '_') AS title
FROM film; 
```

The REPLACE() function is a powerful tool that can be used in many different scenarios as you are preparing and manipulating your datasets.
