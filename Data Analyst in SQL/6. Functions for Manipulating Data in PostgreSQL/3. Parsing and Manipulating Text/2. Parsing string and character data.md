# 1. Parsing string and character data

Next up we will learn about string functions in PostgreSQL that allow us to parse and manipulate text data. We will also learn how to combine and nest functions to provide additional capabilities.

# 2. Determining the length of a string

First, let's look at the CHAR_LENGTH function. The CHAR_LENGTH function can be used to determine the number of characters in a string. CHAR_LENGTH accepts a string as an input and returns the number of characters in the string as an integer for the output. In this example, we see the CHAR_LENGTH function used on the title column of the film table in the DVD Rental database.

# 3. Determining the length of a string

LENGTH is analogous to CHAR_LENGTH, accepts the same parameter and returns the same result as you can see in this example. These two functions can be used interchangeably depending on your preference.

# 4. Finding the position of a character in a string

The POSITION function returns an integer which represents the number of characters from left to right before the search string is located. Looking at the customer table we can find the position of the at sign in the email column.

# 5. Finding the position of a character in a string

STRPOS is analogous to POSITION with a slightly different syntax as you see in this example.

# 6. Parsing string data

Now let's look at some functions that will help you parse strings into substrings. The LEFT function allows you to extract the first "n" characters of a string. In this example, we are going to extract the first fifty characters of the description column from the film table in our DVD Rental database.

# 7. Parsing string data

The RIGHT function is very similar to LEFT but as you might expect it extracts the last "n" characters of a string.

# 8. Extracting substrings of character data

SUBSTRING allows us to do pretty much exactly what its name implies - extract a substring from text data. The substring functions takes 3 parameters. The first is the source string or column, in this example the description column from the film table. This is followed by an integer representing the starting position of the source string or in this case the number 10. Finally, we include another integer to specify the length of the substring that we want to extract. In this case, the number 50.

# 9. Extracting substrings of character data

SUBSTRING can be combined with other functions to provide additional capabilities. In this example, we can extract the text from the left side of the at sign in an email address using a slightly different set of parameters in the SUBSTRING function. The first parameter remains the same, but the second parameter is replaced with the FROM keyword followed by an integer representing the starting position and the third parameter includes the FOR keyword followed by an integer representing the ending position. In this example we use the POSITION function as the second parameter in the SUBSTRING function.

# 10. Extracting substrings of character data

Now we can use a different technique if we want to extract the characters to the right of the at sign in the email column. In this example, we use the POSITION function as the second parameter of SUBSTRING to determine the starting position in the string and the CHAR_LENGTH to determine the last position which is a nice trick for determining the last position of a string. The POSITION function will return the integer value of the position of the at sign in the string. To exclude the at sign from the result, we need to add one to the starting position.

# 11. Extracting substrings of character data

SUBSTR is analogous to SUBSTRING but only allows for the parameters to be separated by commas and does not allow for the alternative syntax with the FROM and FOR keywords.

# 12. Let's practice!

Now it's your turn! Let's practice using these functions in the exercises.

# Determining the length of strings

Determining the number of characters in a string is something that you will use frequently when working with data in a SQL database. Many situations will require you to find the length of a string stored in your database. For example, you may need to limit the number of characters that are displayed in an application or you may need to ensure that a column in your dataset contains values that are all the same length. In this example, we are going to determine the length of the description column in the film table of the DVD Rental database.

Select the title and description columns from the film table.
Find the number of characters in the description column with the alias desc_len.

```
SELECT 
  -- Select the title and description columns
  title,
  description,
  -- Determine the length of the description column
  LENGTH(description) AS desc_len
FROM film;
```

As you'll see in future exercises, the LENGTH() function is useful when combined with other string manipulation functions and operators.

# Truncating strings

In the previous exercise, you calculated the length of the description column and noticed that the number of characters varied but most of the results were over 75 characters. There will be many times when you need to truncate a text column to a certain length to meet specific criteria for an application. In this exercise, we will practice getting the first 50 characters of the description column.

Select the first 50 characters of the description column with the alias short_desc

```
SELECT 
  -- Select the first 50 characters of description
  LEFT(description, 50) AS short_desc
FROM 
  film AS f; 
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/e7a9007f-5465-49cf-b20a-3916564a4a69)

If you look at the results of the query you'll notice that there are several results where the last word has been cut off because it hit the 50 character limit. The last exercise in this chapter will demonstrate how you can truncate this text at the last full word that is less than 50 characters.

# Extracting substrings from text data

In this exercise, you are going to practice how to extract substrings from text columns. The Sakila database contains the address table which stores the street address for all the rental store locations. You need a list of all the street names where the stores are located but the address column also contains the street number. You'll use several functions that you've learned about in the video to manipulate the address column and return only the street address.

Extract only the street address without the street number from the address column.
Use functions to determine the starting and ending position parameters.

```
SELECT 
  -- Select only the street name from the address table
  SUBSTRING(address FROM POSITION(' ' IN address)+1 FOR LENGTH(address))
FROM 
  address;
```

The SUBSTRING() function is useful when you need to parse substrings from the middle of text data and as you can see can be powerful when combined with the POSITION() and LENGTH() functions.

# Combining functions for string manipulation

In the next example, we are going to break apart the email column from the customer table into three new derived fields. Parsing a single column into multiple columns can be useful when you need to work with certain subsets of data. Email addresses have embedded information stored in them that can be parsed out to derive additional information about our data. For example, we can use the techniques we learned about in the video to determine how many of our customers use an email from a specific domain.

Extract the characters to the left of the @ of the email column in the customer table and alias it as username.
Now use SUBSTRING to extract the characters after the @ of the email column and alias the new derived field as domain.

```
SELECT
  -- Extract the characters to the left of the '@'
  LEFT(email, POSITION('@' IN email)-1) AS username,
  -- Extract the characters to the right of the '@'
  SUBSTRING(email FROM POSITION('@' IN email)+1 FOR LENGTH(email)) AS domain
FROM customer;
```

In the next video, we will continue to explore some additional functions for manipulating strings and finish the chapter with a comprehensive example to practice many of the functions we learned about.
