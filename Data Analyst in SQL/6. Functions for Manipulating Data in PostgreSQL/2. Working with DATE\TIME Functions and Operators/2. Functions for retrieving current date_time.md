# 1. Functions for retrieving current date/time

Great work! Now we are going to learn how to retrieve and use the current date and time value in your queries at varying levels of precision.

# 2. Retrieving the current timestamp

As you expand your SQL expertise, one of the most common techniques you'll use is to retrieve the current date and time value in your query. PostgreSQL provides several functions for doing this and we'll explore a few in this video beginning with the NOW() function. NOW() allows you to retrieve a timestamp value for the current date and time at the microsecond precision with time zone.

# 3. Retrieving the current timestamp

Many times you will want to retrieve the current timestamp without the timezone. You can do this by explicitly casting it as seen in this example.

# 4. Retrieving the current timestamp

Casting allows you to convert one data type to another such that columns stored in your database can be retrieved and output as a different type. There are a couple of ways you can cast data in your queries. We saw how to cast the timestamp returned by the NOW() function on the previous slide by adding two colons followed by the new type name. This syntax which uses the double colon operator is specific to PostgreSQL and non-conforming to the SQL standard. You can also use the CAST() function to achieve the same result by specifying the column name or in this case the NOW() function followed by the type name.

# 5. Retrieving the current timestamp

PostgreSQL provides alternative methods for retrieving the current date and time values. The CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function returns the same result of the NOW() function as you see in this example and either approach can be used pretty much interchangeably in your queries.

# 6. Retrieving the current timestamp

One difference between CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and NOW() is that with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP you can specify a precision parameter as you see in the example which will cause the result to have the seconds rounded to the number of fractional digits specified.

# 7. Current date and time

Sometimes you want to get the current date or time but don't require the precision of a timestamp. In these instances you can use the CURRENT_DATE and/or CURRENT_TIME functions to achieve this. In this example, the CURRENT_DATE function will return a date value without the time.

# 8. Current date and time

Additionally, you can use the CURRENT_TIME function to get the time value with timezone without the date value as seen in this example.

# 9. Let's practice!

In the exercises, you'll get some experience on how to retrieve the current timestamp and use what you learned in the previous video to do some arithmetic operations with these results.

# Current timestamp functions

Use the console to explore the NOW(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE and CURRENT_TIME functions and their outputs to determine which of the following is NOT correct?

CURRENT_TIMESTAMP is analogous with NOW() and returns a timestamp with timezone by default.

# Working with the current date and time

Because the Sakila database is a bit dated and most of the date and time values are from 2005 or 2006, you are going to practice using the current date and time in our queries without using Sakila. You'll get back into working with this database in the next video and throughout the remainder of the course. For now, let's practice the techniques you learned about so far in this chapter to work with the current date and time.

As you learned in the video, NOW() and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP can be used interchangeably.

1. Use NOW() to select the current timestamp with timezone.

```
-- Select the current timestamp
SELECT NOW();
```

2. Select the current date without any time value.

```
-- Select the current date
SELECT CURRENT_DATE;
```

3. Now, let's use the CAST() function to eliminate the timezone from the current timestamp.

```
--Select the current timestamp without a timezone
SELECT CAST( NOW() AS TIMESTAMP)
```

4. Finally, let's select the current date.
Use CAST() to retrieve the same result from the NOW() function.

```
SELECT 
	-- Select the current date
	CURRENT_DATE,
    -- CAST the result of the NOW() function to a date
    CAST( NOW() AS date )
```

Understanding how to retrieve and manipulate the current date and time in your queries is a critical SQL skill that you will use often.

# Manipulating the current date and time

Most of the time when you work with the current date and time, you will want to transform, manipulate, or perform operations on the value in your queries. In this exercise, you will practice adding an INTERVAL to the current timestamp as well as perform some more advanced calculations.

Let's practice retrieving the current timestamp. For this exercise, please use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP instead of the NOW() function and if you need to convert a date or time value to a timestamp data type, please use the PostgreSQL specific casting rather than the CAST() function.

1. Select the current timestamp without timezone and alias it as right_now.

```
--Select the current timestamp without timezone
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP::TIMESTAMP AS right_now;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/016ef2ef-a4b9-4f6d-b0cf-167c75062336)

2. Now select a timestamp five days from now and alias it as five_days_from_now.

```
SELECT
	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP::timestamp AS right_now,
    (INTERVAL '5 DAY' + CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)::TIMESTAMP AS five_days_from_now;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/57aeead6-1ed8-447d-87d3-c552162d7b31)

3. Finally, let's use a second-level precision with no fractional digits for both the right_now and five_days_from_now fields.

```
SELECT
	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(2)::timestamp AS right_now,
    interval '5 days' + CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(2) AS five_days_from_now;
```
