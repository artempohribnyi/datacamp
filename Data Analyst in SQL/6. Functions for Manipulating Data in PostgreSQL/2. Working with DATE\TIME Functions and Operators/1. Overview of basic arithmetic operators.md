Explore how to manipulate and query date and time objects including how to use the current timestamp in your queries, extract subfields from existing date and time fields and what to expect when you perform date and time arithmetic.

# 1. Overview of basic arithmetic operators

Now that you have learned the fundamentals of PostgreSQL data types, it's time to learn how to manipulate these data types to assist with your data cleansing and transformation tasks.

# 2. Topics

In this chapter, you'll dive into some built-in date and time functions and operators and learn how to use them to manipulate date and time data. First in this video, you'll learn how to add and subtract date and time values and understand the expected behavior of each operation. Next, you'll learn how to use these functions to retrieve the current date and time. You'll then look at how to use the AGE function to calculate the difference between two timestamps. And finally you'll learn how to use the EXTRACT, DATE_PART, and DATE_TRUNC functions to manipulate timestamps to retrieve subfields of date and time values. Let's get started.

# 3. Adding and subtracting date / time data

Performing basic arithmetic operations on date and time data types will become a useful skill in practice but it's important to understand how the return values for these operations vary depending on the type of date and time data types you are working with. For example, when you subtract date values, the result that is returned is an integer data type.

# 4. Adding and subtracting date / time data

You can also add integer values to date data types. In this example, we are adding the whole number three to a date value and getting a result that is three days greater than the original date. When adding integers to date values, the implied precision is days.

# 5. Adding and subtracting date / time data

However, when we perform the same operation on timestamp data types as you see in this example, we get an INTERVAL as the result.

# 6. Calculating time periods with AGE

The AGE function allows us to calculate the difference between two timestamps. The AGE function takes two timestamp arguments and subtracts the first argument from the second and returns an INTERVAL as a result. You'll notice in this example that the result is identical to what we calculated on the previous slide.

# 7. DVDs, really??

I'm sure that at this point in the course you've questioned why we are using a fictional DVD rental store as our sample dataset. And it would be a valid question. As we talked about earlier in the course, the Sakila database is a widely used sample dataset for working with and learning about relational databases. In fact, it's been more than 13 years since the data in this database was created and the `AGE()` function is a great way to highlight this.

# 8. Date / time arithmetic using INTERVALs

Learning how to use INTERVALs for your date and time calculations is a very useful skill to develop with real world applications. Using an INTERVAL is a great technique when you need to complete relative date and time calculations. If you recall in the first chapter, we calculated the expected_return date by adding an INTERVAL of 3 days to the rental_date column.

# 9. Date / time arithmetic using INTERVALs

You can also perform multiplication and division on date and time data types using intervals which is another useful tool when you have relative date and time data. For example, let's say we wanted to add 21 days to a date value. As you recall from earlier in this video, when you are working with a date data type, you can just add an integer to the date. However, what if you need to perform this calculation with a timestamp? This is where INTERVALs come in handy as you see in this example.

# 10. Let's practice!

Great work! Now let's practice performing basic arithmetic operations on date and time values in the exercises.

# Adding and subtracting date and time values

In this exercise, you will calculate the actual number of days rented as well as the true expected_return_date by using the rental_duration column from the film table along with the familiar rental_date from the rental table.

This will require that you dust off the skills you learned from prior courses on how to join two or more tables together. To select columns from both the film and rental tables in a single query, we'll need to use the inventory table to join these two tables together since there is no explicit relationship between them. Let's give it a try!

1. Subtract the rental_date from the return_date to calculate the number of days_rented.

```
SELECT f.title, f.rental_duration,
    -- Calculate the number of days rented
    r.return_date - r.rental_date AS days_rented
FROM film AS f
     INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
     INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
ORDER BY f.title;
```

2. Now use the AGE() function to calculate the days_rented.

```
SELECT f.title, f.rental_duration,
    -- Calculate the number of days rented
	AGE(return_date, rental_date) AS days_rented
FROM film AS f
	INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
	INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
ORDER BY f.title;
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/9cecf70b-a523-4cce-82ea-f2be8a0965a6)

Notice that there are some records that have a null value for the days_rented calculation. We'll dig into why this is accurate and what it means in the next exercise.

# INTERVAL arithmetic

If you were running a real DVD Rental store, there would be times when you would need to determine what film titles were currently out for rental with customers. In the previous exercise, we saw that some of the records in the results had a NULL value for the return_date. This is because the rental was still outstanding.

Each rental in the film table has an associated rental_duration column which represents the number of days that a DVD can be rented by a customer before it is considered late. In this example, you will exclude films that have a NULL value for the return_date and also convert the rental_duration to an INTERVAL type. Here's a reminder of one method for performing this conversion.
```
SELECT INTERVAL '1' day * timestamp '2019-04-10 12:34:56'
```

Convert rental_duration by multiplying it with a 1 day INTERVAL
Subtract the rental_date from the return_date to calculate the number of days_rented.
Exclude rentals with a NULL value for return_date.

```
SELECT
	f.title,
 	-- Convert the rental_duration to an interval
    INTERVAL '1' DAY * f.rental_duration,
 	-- Calculate the days rented as we did previously
    r.return_date - r.rental_date AS days_rented
FROM film AS f
    INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
    INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
-- Filter the query to exclude outstanding rentals
WHERE r.return_date IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY f.title; 
```

Now let's put it all together to calculate the actual expected_return_date in the final exercise.

# Calculating the expected return date

So now that you've practiced how to add and subtract timestamps and perform relative calculations using intervals, let's use those new skills to calculate the actual expected return date of a specific rental. As you've seen in previous exercises, the rental_duration is the number of days allowed for a rental before it's considered late. To calculate the expected_return_date you will want to use the rental_duration and add it to the rental_date.

Convert rental_duration by multiplying it with a 1-day INTERVAL.
Add it to the rental date.

```
SELECT
    f.title,
	r.rental_date,
    f.rental_duration,
    -- Add the rental duration to the rental date
    INTERVAL '1' day * f.rental_duration + r.rental_date AS expected_return_date,
    r.return_date
FROM film AS f
    INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
    INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
ORDER BY f.title;
```

We can now compare the expected_return_date to the actual return_date to determine if a rental was returned late. In the next video, we'll learn about how to use the current date and time values in our queries.
