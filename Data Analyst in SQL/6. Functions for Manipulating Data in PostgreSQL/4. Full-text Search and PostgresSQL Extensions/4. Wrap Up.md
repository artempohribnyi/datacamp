# 1. Putting it All Together

Let's review what we learned in this course.

# 2. Functions for manipulating data recap and review

First you learned about common data types including strings, numerics and arrays. You learned about arrays and their special characteristics and how to use arrays to store lists of data and access and search elements in the list. Next you learned how to manipulate and query date and time objects including how to use the current timestamp in your queries, extract sub fields from existing date and time fields and what to expect when you perform date and time arithmetic. You learned how to manipulate string and text data by transforming case, parsing and truncating text and extracting substrings from larger strings. And finally, you learned about how to extend PostgreSQL capabilities using extensions and explored full text search using the extensions fuzzystrmatch and pg_trgm.

# 3. Thank you!

Everything you learned in this course will be foundational in your day to day work with PostgreSQL. The functions you learned will be used again and again as you use SQL to manipulate, extract and transform data from PostgreSQL databases. If you'd like to continue learning about PostgreSQL I encourage you to look at the official PostgreSQL website which contains all official documentation, official source code downloads and installation files as well as a community of users ready to help!
