An introduction into some more advanced capabilities of PostgreSQL like full-text search and extensions.

# 1. Introduction to full-text search

Great job! The last three chapters have explored many of the built-in functions available to you in PostgreSQL that will become invaluable skills for transforming and manipulating data using SQL.

# 2. Topics

In this chapter, we are going to get a bit more advanced and explore some of the features of PostgreSQL that allow you to extend its capabilities using custom code. In this chapter we'll explore: An introduction into the full text search capabilities of PostgreSQL that allow you to improve the manner by which you search text columns in your database. An overview of how to extend the features and capabilities of PostgreSQL using extensions. And finally we'll explore how to improve full text search with extensions and some advanced capabilities that you get when you combine the two.

# 3. The LIKE operator

If you remember back in the prerequisite material, the LIKE operator can be used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column. To accomplish this, you use something called a wildcard as a placeholder for some other values. There are two wildcards you can use with LIKE. The first is the underscore sign which matches exactly one character. The second is the percent sign which will match zero or more characters of variable length. In this example we use the percent wildcard to match any title from the film table that starts with the word ELF followed by zero or more characters.

# 4. The LIKE operator

Changing the position of the percent wildcard in our query produces a very different result. In this example, we use the percent sign wildcard to match a string that begins with one or more characters followed by the string ELF.

# 5. The LIKE operator

LIKE is a great tool to use when searching for specific characters in a string. Sometimes when you are preforming a text search, you will want to match variations of the characters you are searching. For example, using LIKE to search the title column for any string that contains the word elf in all lowercase will return zero results. This may be counterintuitive to what you would expect because the LIKE operator matches the exact characters in the query and is case sensitive.

# 6. LIKE versus full-text search

However, look at this query which performs a full text search by using the functions to_tsvector and to_tsquery and the match operator to search the title column. Because full text search accounts for variations of the search string and is case insensitive you will notice that you get the expected results.

# 7. What is full-text search?

So what is full-text search. Full text search provides a means for performing natural language queries of text data by using stemming, fuzzy string matching to handle spelling mistakes and a mechanism to rank results by similarity to the search string.

# 8. Full-text search syntax explained

Full text search can get complex but even a basic full text search query can be a very powerful tool. The example you see here is a basic technique for querying a document, in this case the column title, to match the characters elf. The WHERE clause of the query uses the match operator to compare the values returned by two built-in functions to perform the search, to_tsvector and to_tsquery. These functions convert text and string data to a tsvector data type which is a sorted list of words that have been normalized into variants of the same word. These variants are called `lexemes`.

# 9. Let's practice!

Alright, let's get reacquainted with the LIKE operator and compare it to basic full text search results.

# A review of the LIKE operator

The LIKE operator allows us to filter our queries by matching one or more characters in text data. By using the % wildcard we can match one or more characters in a string. This is useful when you want to return a result set that matches certain characteristics and can also be very helpful during exploratory data analysis or data cleansing tasks.

Let's explore how different usage of the % wildcard will return different results by looking at the film table of the Sakila DVD Rental database.

1. Select all columns for all records that begin with the word GOLD.

```
-- Select all columns
SELECT *
FROM film
-- Select only records that begin with the word 'GOLD'
WHERE title LIKE 'GOLD%';
```

2. Now select all records that end with the word GOLD.

```
SELECT *
FROM film
-- Select only records that end with the word 'GOLD'
WHERE title LIKE '%GOLD';
```

3. Finally, select all records that contain the word 'GOLD'.

```
SELECT *
FROM film
-- Select only records that contain the word 'GOLD'
WHERE title LIKE '%GOLD%';
```

While the LIKE operator is a simple pattern matching tool in your SQL toolbox, it's an expensive operation in terms of performance, so let's practice a much better approach using full-text search.

# What is a tsvector?

You saw how to convert strings to tsvector and tsquery in the video and, in this exercise, we are going to dive deeper into what these functions actually return after converting a string to a tsvector. In this example, you will convert a text column from the film table to a tsvector and inspect the results. Understanding how full-text search works is the first step in more advanced machine learning and data science concepts like natural language processing.

Select the film description and convert it to a tsvector data type.

```
-- Select the film description as a tsvector
SELECT TO_TSVECTOR(description)
FROM film;
```

Now that you've seen what a tsvector data type looks like, let's see how we can use it to perform a basic full-text search.

# Basic full-text search

Searching text will become something you do repeatedly when building applications or exploring data sets for data science. Full-text search is helpful when performing exploratory data analysis for a natural language processing model or building a search feature into your application.

In this exercise, you will practice searching a text column and match it against a string. The search will return the same result as a query that uses the LIKE operator with the % wildcard at the beginning and end of the string, but will perform much better and provide you with a foundation for more advanced full-text search queries. Let's dive in.

Select the title and description columns from the film table.
Perform a full-text search on the title column for the word elf.

```
-- Select the title and description
SELECT title, description
FROM film
-- Convert the title to a tsvector and match it against the tsquery 
WHERE TO_TSVECTOR(title) @@ TO_TSQUERY('elf');
```

Now let's learn how we can extend PostgeSQL with user-defined data types, functions and extensions.
