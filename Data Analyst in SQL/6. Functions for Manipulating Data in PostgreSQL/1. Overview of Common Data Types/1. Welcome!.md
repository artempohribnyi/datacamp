Learn about the properties and characteristics of common data types including strings, numerics and arrays and how to retrieve information about your database.

# 1. Welcome!

Welcome to PostgreSQL Functions for Manipulating Data! My name is Brian Piccolo and I am a Sr. Director of Digital Strategy. I will be your instructor for this course. You've learned some SQL fundamentals in your previous coursework. Now we are going to continue to expand your SQL knowledge by teaching you how to use built-in functions and operators to extend the capabilities of your PostgreSQL database.

# 2. The Sakila Database

You'll be using the Sakila Database which is a well known example database that models a fictional DVD rental store. The database is highly normalized which allows for great sample queries and provides a great representation of PostgreSQL data types and custom functions.

# 3. Topics

Before we get started let's review the topics that will be covered in this course. First in this chapter, you'll learn about some common data types and their properties and characteristics. Next you'll dive into some built-in functions and operators and learn how to use them to manipulate date and time data. You'll then explore some frequently used functions for parsing and manipulating text data types. And finally you'll get an introduction into full-text search using PostgreSQL extensions. Let's get started.

# 4. Common data types

PostgreSQL has a robust set of native data types. Some of the most common include: Text data types like CHAR, VARCHAR and TEXT Numeric data types like INT and DECIMAL Date and time types such as DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP and INTERVAL. And finally ARRAYs. It's important to have an understanding of the properties and characteristics of the various data types anytime you are working with a relational database like PostgreSQL.

# 5. Text data types

Text data types like CHAR and VARCHAR allow for a fixed or varying number of characters and string data. Think about categorical data like the title column from the film table. TEXT data types typically represent character and string data but can be an unlimited length. For example, the text from the description column in the film table. We'll explore how to extract, create substrings and manipulate text data types later on in this course.

# 6. Numeric data types

Numeric data types like INT and DECIMAL allow you to store integers like payment_id and floating point numbers with varying precisions like amount from the payment table. We'll learn more about PostgreSQL date and time and array data types later in this chapter.

# 7. Determining data types from existing tables

When you are working with existing databases, there will be times when you need to determine the data types of columns that you'll be working with. For example, if we look at the results from a simple SELECT query on the film table, you might hypothesize that all the columns in this query have a text data type. But, would you be right? Let's take a closer look.

# 8. Determining data types from existing tables

PostgreSQL stores information about all database objects in a system database called INFORMATION_SCHEMA. By querying certain tables in this database, you can determine information about the database including data types of columns. The following query will return the column_name and the data type for the columns we looked at in the previous slide. When you execute this query, you will get a result that looks like the following. If we look closely at these results we see that the title and description columns are indeed text data types, specifically VARCHAR and TEXT. But we see that special_features is actually an ARRAY. You'll learn more about ARRAYs later in this chapter.

# 9. Let's practice!

Now it's your turn. Let's take a closer look at the customer table of our DVD Rentals database.

# Text data types

You learned about some of the common data types that you'll work within PostgreSQL, some characteristics of these types, and how to determine the data type of a column in an existing table. Think back to the video and answer the following question:

Which of the following is not a valid text data type in PostgreSQL?

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/e8ee5ba5-10ce-4dc4-a542-456263a885be)

STRING is not a valid PostgreSQL data type.

# Getting information about your database

As we saw in the video, PostgreSQL has a system database called INFORMATION_SCHEMA that allows us to extract information about objects, including tables, in our database.

In this exercise we will look at how to query the tables table of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database to discover information about tables in the DVD Rentals database including the name, type, schema, and catalog of all tables and views and then how to use the results to get additional information about columns in our tables.

1. Select all columns from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES system database. Limit results that have a public table_schema.

```
 -- Select all columns from the TABLES system database
 SELECT * 
 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
 -- Filter by schema
 WHERE table_schema = 'public'; 
```

2. Select all columns from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS system database. Limit by table_name to actor

```
 -- Select all columns from the COLUMNS system database
 SELECT * 
 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
 WHERE table_name = 'actor'; 
```

Let's further explore the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS system database in the next exercise.

# Determining data types

The columns table of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database also allows us to extract information about the data types of columns in a table. We can extract information like the character or string length of a CHAR or VARCHAR column or the precision of a DECIMAL or NUMERIC floating point type.

Using the techniques you learned in the lesson, let's explore the customer table of our DVD Rental database.

Select the column name and data type from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS system database.
Limit results to only include the customer table.

```
-- Get the column name and data type
SELECT
 	column_name, 
    data_type
-- From the system database information schema
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
-- For the customer table
WHERE table_name = 'customer';
```

You now have the tool to determine the data types of existing database columns.
