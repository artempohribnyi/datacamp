# 1. Date and time data types

Next up we will learn about some common date and time data types. Understanding how to work with these data types is crucial for preparing and extracting data for machine learning and data science. In this lesson, you will learn about the precision and features of timestamps, intervals and date and time types.

# 2. TIMESTAMP data types

You'll find that most of the date and time data you'll be working with in SQL will have a TIMESTAMP data type. TIMESTAMPs contain both a date value and a time value with microsecond precision. These data types are very common because they can be used to record an exact point in time like when a payment was made or a record was last updated. TIMESTAMPs in PostgreSQL use the ISO 8601 format which is a four digit year followed by a two digit month and day separated by dashes. If you look in the payment table of the Sakila database, you'll see what this format looks like. Notice that the values contain both a date and a time value with seconds precision where the example above was at the microsecond precision.

# 3. DATE and TIME data types

Next, you'll look at DATE and TIME types. When you only need to store a part of the TIMESTAMP in your database, the DATE and TIME types may be better options. DATE and TIME types are essentially the date and time values of the TIMESTAMP. As you see in this example, DATE types contain a date value with no time of day while TIME types contain the time of day but without, you guessed it, a date. If we look at the create_date from the customer table of our DVD rental database you'll see an example of a DATE type.

# 4. INTERVAL data types

Finally INTERVAL types store date and time data as a period of time in years, months, days, hours, seconds, etc. For example, 4 days. INTERVALs are useful when you want to do arithmetic on date and time columns. Here you'll see a query where we calculate an expected return date based on a 3 day rental duration by adding an INTERVAL of 3 days to the rental_date column from the rental table in our DVD database.

# 5. Looking at date and time types

We can use the same technique that we learned in the previous lesson to determine information about a column with a date and time type by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA system database. If we look at the rental_date column of the rental table you'll see that this is a TIMESTAMP. However, you'll also notice the "without time zone" reference. PostgreSQL provides you with the ability to store TIMESTAMP and TIME data types with or without a timezone. While this comes in handy in certain situations, most of the time you'll work with TIMESTAMP values without a timezone which is the default behavior.

# 6. Let's practice!

Now it's your turn. Let's take a closer look at date and time data types in the exercises.

# Properties of date and time data types

Which of the following is NOT correct?

TIME data types can be stored with a timezone but they are stored without a timezone by default.

# Interval data types

INTERVAL data types provide you with a very useful tool for performing arithmetic on date and time data types. For example, let's say our rental policy requires a DVD to be returned within 3 days. We can calculate the expected_return_date for a given DVD rental by adding an INTERVAL of 3 days to the rental_date from the rental table. We can then compare this result to the actual return_date to determine if the DVD was returned late.

Let's try this example in the exercise.

Select the rental date and return date from the rental table.
Add an INTERVAL of 3 days to the rental_date to calculate the expected return date`.

```
SELECT
 	-- Select the rental and return dates
	rental_date,
	return_date,
 	-- Calculate the expected_return_date
	rental_date + INTERVAL '3 days' AS expected_return_date
FROM rental;
```

Looking at the result, we can determine that a DVD was returned late if a record has an expected_return_date earlier than the actual return_date.
