# 1. Working with ARRAYs

Welcome back! Now you will get a bit more advanced as we begin to explore ARRAY data types. Arrays in PostgreSQL are very similar to arrays in most programming languages. You can create multi-dimensional arrays of varying lengths for any native data type in PostgreSQL.

# 2. Before we get started

Before we get started, we want to quickly touch on some concepts that you'll be using in this lesson. Most data science requires getting data out of a database using SQL queries with SELECT statements. But before you are able to extract data, someone needs to create the database, add at least one table with at least one column and then insert some records. The CREATE TABLE command as you see in this example, will create an empty table called my_first_table with the columns first_column and second_column defined as text and integer data types. The INSERT statement example here will add one record into my_first table with 'text value' as the value for the first column and 12 as the value for the second column.

# 3. ARRAY a special type

Now that you have learned some basics about the CREATE TABLE command and INSERT statements, let's see how you can use these skills to create and manipulate ARRAY types. To create an ARRAY type, you simply need to add "square brackets" to the end of the data type that you want to make an array. Let's create a simple table with two array columns to illustrate how this is done. This table has an email column which will be a nested array of text data to store the email type and the address for a given student_id. The test_scores column will contain an array of integer values representing the numeric test score.

# 4. INSERT statements with ARRAYS

Once the table is created we can use the INSERT STATEMENT to add a couple of records to the table. Notice how arrays are represented in the SQL with curly brackets and single quotations for email and comma separated list of whole numbers for test_scores.

# 5. Accessing ARRAYs

Now that we have data in our table, let's see how you access array data in a SELECT statement. Accessing arrays in PostgreSQL is very similar to accessing arrays in other programming languages. For email, you can get the first element of the first array by using the array notation you see here with index values of 1. Note that PostgreSQL array indexes start with one and not zero.

# 6. Searching ARRAYs

The same notation used to access ARRAYs in the SELECT statement, can also be used in the WHERE clause as a filter. Here we look for records that have 'work' as a value in the first index of the email ARRAY. Using standard syntax for non-array columns like WHERE email='work' would generate an error.

# 7. ARRAY functions and operators

The ANY function allows you to search an array for a value and return a record if it finds a match. In this example, we want to query all records where the email address contains 'other' in any value of the array. Notice the null values for type and address. Remember the second record we created earlier in this lesson only had one email address of type work. This means that when we access the second index value for this record by using the number 2 in the first set of square brackets, it would be null because it doesn't exist.

# 8. ARRAY functions and operators

An alternative to the ANY function is the contains operator. The syntax for this operator is a bit more complex but will return the same results as the ANY function as shown in the output below.

# 9. Let's practice!

Now it's your turn to get some practice working with arrays in the exercises.

# Accessing data in an ARRAY

In our DVD Rentals database, the film table contains an ARRAY for special_features which has a type of TEXT[]. Much like any ARRAY data type in PostgreSQL, a TEXT[] array can store an array of TEXT values. This comes in handy when you want to store things like phone numbers or email addresses as we saw in the lesson.

Let's take a look at the special_features column and also practice accessing data in the ARRAY.

1. Select the title and special features from the film table and compare the results between the two columns.

```
-- Select the title and special features column 
SELECT 
  title, 
  special_features 
FROM film;
```

2. Select all films that have a special feature Trailers by filtering on the first index of the special_features ARRAY.

```
-- Select the title and special features column 
SELECT 
  title, 
  special_features 
FROM film
-- Use the array index of the special_features column
WHERE special_features[1] = 'Trailers';
```

3. Now let's select all films that have Deleted Scenes in the second index of the special_features ARRAY.

```
-- Select the title and special features column 
SELECT 
  title, 
  special_features 
FROM film
-- Use the array index of the special_features column
WHERE special_features[2] = 'Deleted Scenes';
```

Understanding how to access ARRAY data types in PostgreSQL is an important skill in your SQL arsenal.

# Searching an ARRAY with ANY

As we saw in the video, PostgreSQL also provides the ability to filter results by searching for values in an ARRAY. The ANY function allows you to search for a value in any index position of an ARRAY. Here's an example.

WHERE 'search text' = ANY(array_name)
When using the ANY function, the value you are filtering on appears on the left side of the equation with the name of the ARRAY column as the parameter in the ANY function.

Match 'Trailers' in any index of the special_features ARRAY regardless of position.

```
SELECT
  title, 
  special_features 
FROM film 
-- Modify the query to use the ANY function 
WHERE 'Trailers' = ANY (special_features);
```

The ANY function is a flexible tool that you will use often when searching an ARRAY data type in PostgreSQL.

# Searching an ARRAY with @>

The contains operator @> operator is alternative syntax to the ANY function and matches data in an ARRAY using the following syntax.

WHERE array_name @> ARRAY['search text'] :: type[]
So let's practice using this operator in the exercise.

Use the contains operator to match the text Deleted Scenes in the special_features column.

```
SELECT 
  title, 
  special_features 
FROM film 
-- Filter where special_features contains 'Deleted Scenes'
WHERE special_features  @> ARRAY['Deleted Scenes'];
```

Now that you have learned about the properties and characteristics of common PostgreSQL data types, we will begin to dive into built-in functions to manipulate and transform these data types in your queries beginning with date and time functions and operators.
