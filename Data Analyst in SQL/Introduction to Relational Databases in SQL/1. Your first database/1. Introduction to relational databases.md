In this chapter, you'll create your very first database with a set of simple SQL commands. Next, you'll migrate data from existing flat tables into that database. You'll also learn how meta-information about a database can be queried.

# 1. Your first database

Welcome to this course on Introduction to Relational Databases. My name is Timo Grossenbacher, and I work as a data journalist in Switzerland. In this course, you will see why using relational databases has many advantages over using flat files like CSVs or Excel sheets. You'll learn how to create such databases, and bring into force their most prominent features.

# 2. Investigating universities in Switzerland

Let me tell you a little story first. As a data journalist, I try to uncover corruption, misconduct and other newsworthy stuff with data. A couple of years ago I researched secondary employment of Swiss university professors. It turns out a lot of them have more than one side job besides their university duty, being paid by big companies like banks and insurances. So I discovered more than 1500 external employments and visualized them in an interactive graphic, shown on the left. For this story, I had to compile data from various sources with varying quality. Also, I had to account for certain specialties, for example, that a professor can work for different universities; or that a third-party company can have multiple professors working for them. In order to analyze the data, I needed to make sure its quality was good and stayed good throughout the process. That's why I stored my data in a database, whose quite complex design you can see in the right graphic. All these rectangles were turned into database tables.

# 3. A relational database:

But why did I use a database? A database models real-life entities like professors and universities by storing them in tables. Each table only contains data from a single entity type. This reduces redundancy by storing entities only once – for example, there only needs to be one row of data containing the details of a certain company. Lastly, a database can be used to model relationships between entities. You can define exactly how entities relate to each other. For instance, a professor can work at multiple universities and companies, while a company can employ more than one professor.

# 4. Throughout this course you will:

Throughout this course, you will actually work with the same real-life data used during my investigation. You'll start from a single table of data and build a full-blown relational database from it, column by column, table by table. By doing so, you'll get to know constraints, keys, and referential integrity. These three concepts help preserve data quality in databases. By the end of the course, you'll know how to use them. In order to get going, you'll just need a basic understanding of SQL – which can also be used to build and maintain databases, not just for querying data.

# 5. Your first duty: Have a look at the PostgreSQL database

I've already created a single PostgreSQL database table containing all the raw data for this course. In the next few exercises, I want you to have a look at that table. For that, you'll need to retrieve your SQL knowledge and query the "information_schema" database, which is available in PostgreSQL by default. "information_schema" is actually some sort of meta-database that holds information about your current database. It's not PostgreSQL specific and also available in other database management systems like MySQL or SQL Server. This "information_schema" database holds various information in different tables, for example in the "tables" table.

# 6. Have a look at the columns of a certain table

"information_schema" also holds information about columns in the "columns" table. Once you know the name of a table, you can query its columns by accessing the "columns" table. Here, for example, you see that the system table "pg_config" has only two columns – supposedly for storing name-value pairs.

# 7. Let's do this.

Okay, let's have a look at your first database.

# Attributes of relational databases

In the video, we talked about some basic facts about relational databases. Which of the following statements does not hold true for databases? Relational databases …

Of course, databases can also store information about any other kind of entities, e.g. spare car parts.

# Query information_schema with SELECT

information_schema is a meta-database that holds information about your current database. information_schema has multiple tables you can query with the known SELECT * FROM syntax:

tables: information about all tables in your current database
columns: information about all columns in all of the tables in your current database
…
In this exercise, you'll only need information from the 'public' schema, which is specified as the column table_schema of the tables and columns tables. The 'public' schema holds information about user-defined tables and databases. The other types of table_schema hold system information – for this course, you're only interested in user-defined stuff.

1. Get information on all table names in the current database, while limiting your query to the 'public' table_schema.

```
-- Query the right table in information_schema
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables
-- Specify the correct table_schema value
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

2. Now have a look at the columns in university_professors by selecting all entries in information_schema.columns that correspond to that table.

```
-- Query the right table in information_schema to get columns
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'university_professors' AND table_schema = 'public';
```

3. How many columns does the table university_professors have?

4. Finally, print the first five rows of the university_professors table.

```
-- Query the first five rows of our table
SELECT * 
FROM university_professors 
LIMIT 5;
```

You're now familiar with the pre-existing university_professors table, which holds information on all kinds of entities. You'll migrate data from this table to other tables in the upcoming lessons.
