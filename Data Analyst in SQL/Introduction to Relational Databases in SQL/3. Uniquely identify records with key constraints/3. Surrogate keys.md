# 1. Surrogate keys

Surrogate keys are sort of an artificial primary key. In other words, they are not based on a native column in your data, but on a column that just exists for the sake of having a primary key. Why would you need that?

# 2. Surrogate keys

There are several reasons for creating an artificial surrogate key. As mentioned before, a primary key is ideally constructed from as few columns as possible. Secondly, the primary key of a record should never change over time. If you define an artificial primary key, ideally consisting of a unique number or string, you can be sure that this number stays the same for each record. Other attributes might change, but the primary key always has the same value for a given record.

# 3. An example

Let's look back at the example in the first video of this chapter. I altered it slightly and added the "color" column. In this table, the "license_no" column would be suited as the primary key – the license number is unlikely to change over time, not like the color column, for example, which might change if the car is repainted. So there's no need for a surrogate key here. However, let's say there were only these three attributes in the table. The only sensible primary key would be the combination of "make" and "model", but that's two columns for the primary key.

# 4. Adding a surrogate key with serial data type

You could add a new surrogate key column, called "id", to solve this problem. Actually, there's a special data type in PostgreSQL that allows the addition of auto-incrementing numbers to an existing table: the "serial" type. It is specified just like any other data type. Once you add a column with the "serial" type, all the records in your table will be numbered. Whenever you add a new record to the table, it will automatically get a number that does not exist yet. There are similar data types in other database management systems, like MySQL.

# 5. Adding a surrogate key with serial data type (contd.)

Also, if you try to specify an ID that already exists, the primary key constraint will prevent you from doing so. So, after all, the "id" column uniquely identifies each record in this table – which is very useful, for example, when you want to refer to these records from another table. But this will be the subject of the next chapter.

# 6. Another type of surrogate key

Another strategy for creating a surrogate key is to combine two existing columns into a new one. In this example, we first add a new column with the "varchar" data type. We then "UPDATE" that column with the concatenation of two existing columns. The "CONCAT" function glues together the values of two or more existing columns. Lastly, we turn that new column into a surrogate primary key.

# 7. Your database

In the exercises, you'll add a surrogate key to the "professors" table, because the existing attributes are not really suited as primary key. Theoretically, there could be more than one professor with the same name working for one university, resulting in duplicates. With an auto-incrementing "id" column as the primary key, you make sure that each professor can be uniquely referred to. This was not necessary for organizations and universities, as their names can be assumed to be unique across these tables. In other words: It is unlikely that two organizations with the same name exist, solely for trademark reasons. The same goes for universities.

# 8. Let's try this!

Let's try this out before you move on to the last chapter.

# Add a SERIAL surrogate key

Since there's no single column candidate key in professors (only a composite key candidate consisting of firstname, lastname), you'll add a new column id to that table.

This column has a special data type serial, which turns the column into an auto-incrementing number. This means that, whenever you add a new professor to the table, it will automatically get an id that does not exist yet in the table: a perfect primary key!

1. Add a new column id with data type serial to the professors table.

```
-- Add the new column to the table
ALTER TABLE professors
ADD COLUMN id serial PRIMARY KEY;
```

2. Make id a primary key and name it professors_pkey.

```
-- Add the new column to the table
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD COLUMN id serial;

-- Make id a primary key
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD CONSTRAINT professors_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id);
```

3. Write a query that returns all the columns and 10 rows from professors.

```
-- Add the new column to the table
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD COLUMN id serial;

-- Make id a primary key
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD CONSTRAINT professors_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id);

-- Have a look at the first 10 rows of professors
SELECT *
  FROM professors
 LIMIT 10;
```

As you can see, PostgreSQL has automatically numbered the rows with the id column, which now functions as a (surrogate) primary key – it uniquely identifies professors.

# CONCATenate columns to a surrogate key

Another strategy to add a surrogate key to an existing table is to concatenate existing columns with the CONCAT() function.

Let's think of the following example table:
```
CREATE TABLE cars (
 make varchar(64) NOT NULL,
 model varchar(64) NOT NULL,
 mpg integer NOT NULL
)
```
The table is populated with 10 rows of completely fictional data.

Unfortunately, the table doesn't have a primary key yet. None of the columns consists of only unique values, so some columns can be combined to form a key.

In the course of the following exercises, you will combine make and model into such a surrogate key.

1. Count the number of distinct rows with a combination of the make and model columns.

```
-- Count the number of distinct rows with columns make, model
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(make, model))
FROM cars;
```

2. Add a new column id with the data type varchar(128).

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(make, model)) 
FROM cars;

-- Add the id column
ALTER TABLE cars
ADD COLUMN id VARCHAR(128);
```

3. Concatenate make and model into id using an UPDATE table_name SET column_name = ... query and the CONCAT() function.

```
-- Count the number of distinct rows with columns make, model
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(make, model)) 
FROM cars;

-- Add the id column
ALTER TABLE cars
ADD COLUMN id varchar(128);

-- Update id with make + model
UPDATE cars
SET id = CONCAT(make, model);
```

4. Make id a primary key and name it id_pk.

```
-- Count the number of distinct rows with columns make, model
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(make, model)) 
FROM cars;

-- Add the id column
ALTER TABLE cars
ADD COLUMN id varchar(128);

-- Update id with make + model
UPDATE cars
SET id = CONCAT(make, model);

-- Make id a primary key
ALTER TABLE cars
ADD CONSTRAINT id_pk PRIMARY KEY(id);

-- Have a look at the table
SELECT * FROM cars;
```

These were quite some steps, but you've managed! Let's look into another method of adding a surrogate key now.

# Test your knowledge before advancing

Before you move on to the next chapter, let's quickly review what you've learned so far about attributes and key constraints. If you're unsure about the answer, please quickly review chapters 2 and 3, respectively.

Let's think of an entity type "student". A student has:

a last name consisting of up to 128 characters (required),
a unique social security number, consisting only of integers, that should serve as a key,
a phone number of fixed length 12, consisting of numbers and characters (but some students don't have one).

Given the above description of a student entity, create a table students with the correct column types.
Add a PRIMARY KEY for the social security number ssn.
Note that there is no formal length requirement for the integer column. The application would have to make sure it's a correct SSN!

```
-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE students (
  last_name VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
  ssn INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  phone_no CHAR(12)
);
```

Looks like you are ready for the last chapter of this course, where you'll connect tables in your database.
