Now let’s get into the best practices of database engineering. It's time to add primary and foreign keys to the tables. These are two of the most important concepts in databases, and are the building blocks you’ll use to establish relationships between tables.

# 1. Keys and superkeys

Welcome back! Let's discuss key constraints. They are a very important concept in database systems, so we'll spend a whole chapter on them.

# 2. The current database model

Let's have a look at your current database model first. In the last chapter, you specified attribute constraints, first and foremost data types. You also set not-null and unique constraints on certain attributes. This didn't actually change the structure of the model, so it still looks the same.

# 3. The database model with primary keys

By the end of this chapter, the database will look slightly different. You'll add so-called primary keys to three different tables. You'll name them "id". In the entity-relationship diagram, keys are denoted by underlined attribute names. Notice that you'll add a whole new attribute to the "professors" table, and you'll modify existing columns of the "organizations" and "universities" tables.

# 4. What is a key?

Before we go into the nitty-gritty of what a primary key actually is, let's look at keys in general. Typically a database table has an attribute, or a combination of multiple attributes, whose values are unique across the whole table. Such attributes identify a record uniquely. Normally, a table, as a whole, only contains unique records, meaning that the combination of all attributes is a key in itself. However, it's not called a key, but a superkey, if attributes from that combination can be removed, and the attributes still uniquely identify records. If all possible attributes have been removed but the records are still uniquely identifiable by the remaining attributes, we speak of a minimal superkey. This is the actual key. So a key is always minimal. Let's look at an example.

# 5. An example

Here's an example that I found in a textbook on database systems. Obviously, the table shows six different cars, so the combination of all attributes is a superkey. If we remove the "year" attribute from the superkey, the six records are still unique, so it's still a superkey. Actually, there are a lot of possible superkeys in this example.

# 6. An example (contd.)

However, there are only four minimal superkeys, and these are "license_no", "serial_no", and "model", as well as the combination of "make" and "year". Remember that superkeys are minimal if no attributes can be removed without losing the uniqueness property. This is trivial for K1 to 3, as they only consist of a single attribute. Also, if we remove "year" from K4, "make" would contain duplicates, and would, therefore, be no longer suited as key. These four minimal superkeys are also called candidate keys. Why candidate keys? In the end, there can only be one key for the table, which has to be chosen from the candidates. More on that in the next video.

# 7. Let's discover some keys!

First I want you to have a look at some tables in your database and think about keys.

# Get to know SELECT COUNT DISTINCT

Your database doesn't have any defined keys so far, and you don't know which columns or combinations of columns are suited as keys.

There's a simple way of finding out whether a certain column (or a combination) contains only unique values – and thus identifies the records in the table.

You already know the SELECT DISTINCT query from the first chapter. Now you just have to wrap everything within the COUNT() function and PostgreSQL will return the number of unique rows for the given columns:
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(column_a, column_b, ...))
FROM table;
```

1. First, find out the number of rows in universities.

```
-- Count the number of rows in universities
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM universities;
```

2. Then, find out how many unique values there are in the university_city column.

```
-- Count the number of distinct values in the university_city column
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(university_city)) 
FROM universities;
```

So, obviously, the university_city column wouldn't lend itself as a key. Why? Because there are only 9 distinct values, but the table has 11 rows.

# Identify keys with SELECT COUNT DISTINCT

There's a very basic way of finding out what qualifies for a key in an existing, populated table:

Count the distinct records for all possible combinations of columns. If the resulting number x equals the number of all rows in the table for a combination, you have discovered a superkey.

Then remove one column after another until you can no longer remove columns without seeing the number x decrease. If that is the case, you have discovered a (candidate) key.

The table professors has 551 rows. It has only one possible candidate key, which is a combination of two attributes. You might want to try different combinations using the "Run code" button. Once you have found the solution, you can submit your answer.

Using the above steps, identify the candidate key by trying out different combination of columns.

```
-- Try out different combinations
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(firstname, lastname)) 
FROM professors;
```

Indeed, the only combination that uniquely identifies professors is {firstname, lastname}. {firstname, lastname, university_shortname} is a superkey, and all other combinations give duplicate values. Hopefully, the concept of superkeys and keys is now a bit more clear. Let's move on to primary keys!
