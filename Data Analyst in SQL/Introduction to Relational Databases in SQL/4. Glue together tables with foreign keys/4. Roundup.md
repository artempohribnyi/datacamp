# 1. Roundup

Congratulations, you're almost done. Let's quickly revise what you've done throughout this course.

# 2. How you've transformed the database

You started with a simple table with a lot of redundancy. You might be used to such tables when working with flat files like CSVs or Excel files. Throughout the course, you transformed it step by step into the database schema on the right â€“ only by executing SQL queries. You've defined column data types, added primary keys and foreign keys, and through that, specified relationships between tables. All these measures will guarantee better data consistency and therefore quality. This is especially helpful if you add new data to the database but also makes analyzing the data easier.

# 3. The database ecosystem

To go further from here, it's useful to look at the bigger picture for a minute. In this course, you've transformed a database. You did that with PostgreSQL, which is also called a "Database Management System", or DBMS. The DBMS and one or more databases together form the "Database System". The DBMS exposes a query interface where you can run ad-hoc analyses and queries with SQL. However, you can also access this interface through other client applications. You could, for example, program a Python script that connects to the database, loads data from it, and visualizes it.

# 4. The database ecosystem

In the remainder of this course, you'll no longer manipulate data in your database system, but employ some analysis queries on your database. This will be a quick repetition of what you've learned in previous SQL courses such as "Intro to SQL for Data Science", but it will also demonstrate the advantages of having a database instead of a flat file in the first place.

# 5. Thank you!

For me it's time to say goodbye, thank you for taking this course, and I hope you will soon build your first relational database with the knowledge you've gained here.

# Count affiliations per university

Now that your data is ready for analysis, let's run some exemplary SQL queries on the database. You'll now use already known concepts such as grouping by columns and joining tables.

In this exercise, you will find out which university has the most affiliations (through its professors). For that, you need both affiliations and professors tables, as the latter also holds the university_id.

As a quick repetition, remember that joins have the following structure:

```
SELECT table_a.column1, table_a.column2, table_b.column1, ... 
FROM table_a
JOIN table_b 
ON table_a.column = table_b.column
```

This results in a combination of table_a and table_b, but only with rows where table_a.column is equal to table_b.column.

* Count the number of total affiliations by university.
* Sort the result by that count, in descending order.

```
-- Count the total number of affiliations per university
SELECT COUNT(*), professors.university_id 
FROM affiliations
JOIN professors
ON affiliations.professor_id = professors.id
-- Group by the university ids of professors
GROUP BY professors.university_id 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

Very good. As you can see, the count of affiliations is completely different from university to university.

# Join all the tables together

In this last exercise, your task is to find the university city of the professor with the most affiliations in the sector "Media & communication".

For this,

* you need to join all the tables,
* group by some column,
* and then use selection criteria to get only the rows in the correct sector.

Let's do this in three steps!

1. Join all tables in the database (starting with affiliations, professors, organizations, and universities) and look at the result.

```
-- Join all tables
SELECT *
FROM affiliations
JOIN professors
ON affiliations.professor_id = professors.id
JOIN organizations
ON affiliations.organization_id = organizations.id
JOIN universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id;
```

2. Now group the result by organization sector, professor, and university city.
Count the resulting number of rows.

```
-- Group the table by organization sector, professor ID and university city
SELECT COUNT(*), organizations.organization_sector, 
professors.id, universities.university_city
FROM affiliations
JOIN professors
ON affiliations.professor_id = professors.id
JOIN organizations
ON affiliations.organization_id = organizations.id
JOIN universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id
GROUP BY organizations.organization_sector, 
professors.id, universities.university_city;
```

3. Only retain rows with "Media & communication" as organization sector, and sort the table by count, in descending order.

```
-- Filter the table and sort it
SELECT COUNT(*), organizations.organization_sector, 
professors.id, universities.university_city
FROM affiliations
JOIN professors
ON affiliations.professor_id = professors.id
JOIN organizations
ON affiliations.organization_id = organizations.id
JOIN universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id
WHERE organizations.organization_sector = 'Media & communication'
GROUP BY organizations.organization_sector, 
professors.id, universities.university_city
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

Good job! The professor with id 538 has the most affiliations in the "Media & communication" sector, and he or she lives in the city of Lausanne. Thanks to your database design, you can be sure that the data you've just queried is consistent. Of course, you could also put university_city and organization_sector in their own tables, making the data model even more formal. However, in database design, you have to strike a balance between modeling overhead, desired data consistency, and usability for queries like the one you've just wrote. Congratulations, you made it to the end!
