# 1. Referential integrity

We'll now talk about one of the most important concepts in database systems: referential integrity. It's a very simple concept...

# 2. Referential integrity

...that states that a record referencing another record in another table must always refer to an existing record. In other words: A record in table A cannot point to a record in table B that does not exist. Referential integrity is a constraint that always concerns two tables, and is enforced through foreign keys, as you've seen in the previous lessons of this chapter. So if you define a foreign key in the table "professors" referencing the table "universities", referential integrity is held from "professors" to "universities".

# 3. Referential integrity violations

Referential integrity can be violated in two ways. Let's say table A references table B. So if a record in table B that is already referenced from table A is deleted, you have a violation. On the other hand, if you try to insert a record in table A that refers to something that does not exist in table B, you also violate the principle. And that's the main reason for foreign keys â€“ they will throw errors and stop you from accidentally doing these things.

# 4. Dealing with violations

However, throwing an error is not the only option. If you specify a foreign key on a column, you can actually tell the database system what should happen if an entry in the referenced table is deleted. By default, the "ON DELETE NO ACTION" keyword is automatically appended to a foreign key definition, like in the example here. This means that if you try to delete a record in table B which is referenced from table A, the system will throw an error. However, there are other options. For example, there's the "CASCADE" option, which will first allow the deletion of the record in table B, and then will automatically delete all referencing records in table A. So that deletion is cascaded.

# 5. Dealing with violations, contd.

There are even more options. The "RESTRICT" option is almost identical to the "NO ACTION" option. The differences are technical and beyond the scope of this course. More interesting is the "SET NULL" option. It will set the value of the foreign key for this record to "NULL". The "SET DEFAULT" option only works if you have specified a default value for a column. It automatically changes the referencing column to a certain default value if the referenced record is deleted. Setting default values is also beyond the scope of this course, but this option is still good to know.

# 6. Let's look at some examples!

Let's practice this a bit and change the referential integrity behavior of your database.

# Referential integrity violations

Given the current state of your database, what happens if you execute the following SQL statement?

```
DELETE FROM universities WHERE id = 'EPF';
```

Correct! You defined a foreign key on professors.university_id that references universities.id, so referential integrity is said to hold from professors to universities.

# Change the referential integrity behavior of a key

So far, you implemented three foreign key constraints:

professors.university_id to universities.id
affiliations.organization_id to organizations.id
affiliations.professor_id to professors.id
These foreign keys currently have the behavior ON DELETE NO ACTION. Here, you're going to change that behavior for the column referencing organizations from affiliations. If an organization is deleted, all its affiliations (by any professor) should also be deleted.

Altering a key constraint doesn't work with ALTER COLUMN. Instead, you have to DROP the key constraint and then ADD a new one with a different ON DELETE behavior.

For deleting constraints, though, you need to know their name. This information is also stored in information_schema.

1. Have a look at the existing foreign key constraints by querying table_constraints in information_schema.

```
-- Identify the correct constraint name
SELECT constraint_name, table_name, constraint_type
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
```

2. Delete the affiliations_organization_id_fkey foreign key constraint in affiliations.

```
-- Identify the correct constraint name
SELECT constraint_name, table_name, constraint_type
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';

-- Drop the right foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_id_fkey;
```

3. Add a new foreign key to affiliations that CASCADEs deletion if a referenced record is deleted from organizations. Name it affiliations_organization_id_fkey.

```
-- Identify the correct constraint name
SELECT constraint_name, table_name, constraint_type
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';

-- Drop the right foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_id_fkey;

-- Add a new foreign key constraint from affiliations to organizations which cascades deletion
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

4. Run the DELETE and SELECT queries to double check that the deletion cascade actually works.

```
-- Identify the correct constraint name
SELECT constraint_name, table_name, constraint_type
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';

-- Drop the right foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_id_fkey;

-- Add a new foreign key constraint from affiliations to organizations which cascades deletion
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Delete an organization 
DELETE FROM organizations 
WHERE id = 'CUREM';

-- Check that no more affiliations with this organization exist
SELECT * FROM affiliations
WHERE organization_id = 'CUREM';
```

Good job. As you can see, whenever an organization referenced by an affiliation is deleted, the affiliations also gets deleted. It is your job as database designer to judge whether this is a sensible configuration. Sometimes, setting values to NULL or to restrict deletion altogether might make more sense!
