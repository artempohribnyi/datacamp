In the final chapter, you'll leverage foreign keys to connect tables and establish relationships that will greatly benefit your data quality. And you'll run ad hoc analyses on your new database.

# 1. Model 1:N relationships with foreign keys

Welcome to the last chapter of this course. Now it's time to make use of key constraints.

# 2. The current database model

Here's your current database model. The three entity types "professors", "organizations", and "universities" all have primary keys – but "affiliations" doesn't, for a specific reason that will be revealed in this chapter.

# 3. The next database model

Next up, you'll model a so-called relationship type between "professors" and "universities". As you know, in your database, each professor works for a university. In the ER diagram, this is drawn with a rhombus. The small numbers specify the cardinality of the relationship: a professor works for at most one university, while a university can have any number of professors working for it – even zero.

# 4. Implementing relationships with foreign keys

Such relationships are implemented with foreign keys. Foreign keys are designated columns that point to a primary key of another table. There are some restrictions for foreign keys. First, the domain and the data type must be the same as one of the primary key. Secondly, only foreign key values are allowed that exist as values in the primary key of the referenced table. This is the actual foreign key constraint, also called "referential integrity". You'll dig into referential integrity at the end of this chapter. Lastly, a foreign key is not necessarily an actual key, because duplicates and "NULL" values are allowed. Let's have a look at your database.

# 5. A query

As you can see, the column "university_shortname" of "professors" has the same domain as the "id" column of the "universities" table. If you go through each record of "professors", you can always find the respective "id" in the "universities" table. So both criteria for a foreign key in the table "professors" referencing "universities" are fulfilled. Also, you see that "university_shortname" is not really a key because there are duplicates. For example, the id "EPF" and "UBE" occur three times each.

# 6. Specifying foreign keys

When you create a new table, you can specify a foreign key similarly to a primary key. Let's look at two example tables. First, we create a "manufacturers" table with a primary key called "name". Then we create a table "cars", that also has a primary key, called "model". As each car is produced by a certain manufacturer, it makes sense to also add a foreign key to this table. We do that by writing the "REFERENCES" keyword, followed by the referenced table and its primary key in brackets. From now on, only cars with valid and existing manufacturers may be entered into that table. Trying to enter models with manufacturers that are not yet stored in the "manufacturers" table won't be possible, thanks to the foreign key constraint.

# 7. Specifying foreign keys to existing tables

Again, the syntax for adding foreign keys to existing tables is the same as the one for adding primary keys and unique constraints.

# 8. Let's implement this!

Okay, let's have a look at your database and implement a simple relationship between "professors" and "universities".

# REFERENCE a table with a FOREIGN KEY

In your database, you want the professors table to reference the universities table. You can do that by specifying a column in professors table that references a column in the universities table.

As just shown in the video, the syntax for that looks like this:

```
ALTER TABLE a 
ADD CONSTRAINT a_fkey FOREIGN KEY (b_id) REFERENCES b (id);
Table a should now refer to table b, via b_id, which points to id. a_fkey is, as usual, a constraint name you can choose on your own.
```

Pay attention to the naming convention employed here: Usually, a foreign key referencing another primary key with name id is named x_id, where x is the name of the referencing table in the singular form.

1. Rename the university_shortname column to university_id in professors.

```
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;
```

2. Add a foreign key on university_id column in professors that references the id column in universities.
Name this foreign key professors_fkey.

```
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;

-- Add a foreign key on professors referencing universities
ALTER TABLE professors 
ADD CONSTRAINT professors_fkey FOREIGN KEY (university_id) REFERENCES universities (id);
```

Perfect! Now, the professors table has a link to the universities table. Each professor belongs to exactly one university.

# Explore foreign key constraints

Foreign key constraints help you to keep order in your database mini-world. In your database, for instance, only professors belonging to Swiss universities should be allowed, as only Swiss universities are part of the universities table.

The foreign key on professors referencing universities you just created thus makes sure that only existing universities can be specified when inserting new data. Let's test this!

* Run the sample code and have a look at the error message.
* What's wrong? Correct the university_id so that it actually reflects where Albert Einstein wrote his dissertation and became a professor – at the University of Zurich (UZH)!

```
-- Try to insert a new professor
INSERT INTO professors (firstname, lastname, university_id)
VALUES ('Albert', 'Einstein', 'UZH');
```

Great! As you can see, inserting a professor with non-existing university IDs violates the foreign key constraint you've just added. This also makes sure that all universities are spelled equally – adding to data consistency.

# JOIN tables linked by a foreign key

Let's join these two tables to analyze the data further!

You might already know how SQL joins work from the Intro to SQL for Data Science course (last exercise) or from Joining Data in PostgreSQL.

Here's a quick recap on how joins generally work:

```
SELECT ...
FROM table_a
JOIN table_b
ON ...
WHERE ...
```

While foreign keys and primary keys are not strictly necessary for join queries, they greatly help by telling you what to expect. For instance, you can be sure that records referenced from table A will always be present in table B – so a join from table A will always find something in table B. If not, the foreign key constraint would be violated.

JOIN professors with universities on professors.university_id = universities.id, i.e., retain all records where the foreign key of professors is equal to the primary key of universities.
Filter for university_city = 'Zurich'.

```
-- Select all professors working for universities in the city of Zurich
SELECT professors.lastname, universities.id, universities.university_city
FROM professors
JOIN universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id
WHERE universities.university_city = 'Zurich';
```

![image](https://github.com/artempohribnyi/datacamp/assets/113499718/ba0a1808-447d-4215-8e77-bbc01ccfdaa2)

That's a long query! First, the university belonging to each professor was attached with the JOIN operation. Then, only professors having "Zurich"" as university city were retained with the WHERE clause.
