# 1. Model more complex relationships

In the last few exercises, you made your first steps in modeling and implementing 1:N-relationships. Now it's time to look at more complex relationships between tables.

# 2. The current database model

So you've added a 1:N-relationship between professors and universities. Such relationships have to be implemented with one foreign key in the table that has at most one foreign entity associated. In this case, that's the "professors" table, as professors cannot have more than one university associated. Now, what about affiliations? We know that a professor can have more than one affiliation with organizations, for instance, as a chairman of a bank and as a president of a golf club. On the other hand, organizations can also have more than one professor connected to them. Let's look at the entity-relationship diagram that models this.

# 3. The final database model

There are a couple of things that are new. First of all, a new relationship between organizations and professors was added. This is an N:M relationship, not an 1:N relationship as with professors and universities. This depicts the fact that a professor can be affiliated with more than one organization and vice versa. Also, it has an own attribute, the function. Remember that each affiliation comes with a function, for instance, "chairman". The second thing you'll notice is that the affiliations entity type disappeared altogether. For clarity, I still included it in the diagram, but it's no longer needed. However, you'll still have four tables: Three for the entities "professors", "universities" and "organizations", and one for the N:M-relationship between "professors" and "organizations".

# 4. How to implement N:M-relationships

Such a relationship is implemented with an ordinary database table that contains two foreign keys that point to both connected entities. In this case, that's a foreign key pointing to the "professors.id" column, and one pointing to the "organizations.id" column. Also, additional attributes, in this case "function", need to be included. If you were to create that relationship table from scratch, you would define it as shown. Note that "professor_id" is stored as "integer", as the primary key it refers to has the type "serial", which is also an integer. On the other hand, "organization_id" has "varchar(256)" as type, conforming to the primary key in the "organizations" table. One last thing: Notice that no primary key is defined here because a professor can theoretically have multiple functions in one organization. One could define the combination of all three attributes as the primary key in order to have some form of unique constraint in that table, but that would be a bit over the top.

# 5. Time to implement this!

Since you already have a pre-populated affiliations table, things are not going to be so straightforward. You'll need to link and migrate the data to a new table to implement this relationship. This will be the goal of the following exercises.

# Add foreign keys to the "affiliations" table

At the moment, the affiliations table has the structure {firstname, lastname, function, organization}, as you can see in the preview at the bottom right. In the next three exercises, you're going to turn this table into the form {professor_id, organization_id, function}, with professor_id and organization_id being foreign keys that point to the respective tables.

You're going to transform the affiliations table in-place, i.e., without creating a temporary table to cache your intermediate results.

1. Add a professor_id column with integer data type to affiliations, and declare it to be a foreign key that references the id column in professors.

```
-- Add a professor_id column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD COLUMN professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id);
```

2. Rename the organization column in affiliations to organization_id.

```
-- Add a professor_id column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD COLUMN professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id);

-- Rename the organization column to organization_id
ALTER TABLE affiliations
RENAME organization TO organization_id;
```

3. Add a foreign key constraint on organization_id so that it references the id column in organizations.

```
-- Add a professor_id column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD COLUMN professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id);

-- Rename the organization column to organization_id
ALTER TABLE affiliations
RENAME organization TO organization_id;

-- Add a foreign key on organization_id
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations (id);
```

Perfect! Making organization_id a foreign key worked flawlessly because these organizations actually exist in the organizations table. That was only the first part, though. Now it's time to update professor_id in affiliations – so that it correctly refers to the corresponding professors.

# Populate the "professor_id" column

Now it's time to also populate professors_id. You'll take the ID directly from professors.

Here's a way to update columns of a table based on values in another table:

```
UPDATE table_a
SET column_to_update = table_b.column_to_update_from
FROM table_b
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND ...;
```

This query does the following:

For each row in table_a, find the corresponding row in table_b where condition1, condition2, etc., are met.
Set the value of column_to_update to the value of column_to_update_from (from that corresponding row).
The conditions usually compare other columns of both tables, e.g. table_a.some_column = table_b.some_column. Of course, this query only makes sense if there is only one matching row in table_b.

1. First, have a look at the current state of affiliations by fetching 10 rows and all columns.

```
-- Have a look at the 10 first rows of affiliations
SELECT *
FROM affiliations
LIMIT 10;
```

2. Update the professor_id column with the corresponding value of the id column in professors.
"Corresponding" means rows in professors where the firstname and lastname are identical to the ones in affiliations.

```
-- Set professor_id to professors.id where firstname, lastname correspond to rows in professors
UPDATE affiliations
SET professor_id = professors.id
FROM professors
WHERE affiliations.firstname = professors.firstname AND affiliations.lastname = professors.lastname;
```

3. Check out the first 10 rows and all columns of affiliations again. Have the professor_ids been correctly matched?

```
-- Update professor_id to professors.id where firstname, lastname correspond to rows in professors
UPDATE affiliations
SET professor_id = professors.id
FROM professors
WHERE affiliations.firstname = professors.firstname AND affiliations.lastname = professors.lastname;

-- Have a look at the 10 first rows of affiliations again
SELECT *
FROM affiliations
LIMIT 10;
```

Wow, that was a thing! As you can see, the correct professors.id has been inserted into professor_id for each record, thanks to the matching firstname and lastname in both tables.

# Drop "firstname" and "lastname"

The firstname and lastname columns of affiliations were used to establish a link to the professors table in the last exercise – so the appropriate professor IDs could be copied over. This only worked because there is exactly one corresponding professor for each row in affiliations. In other words: {firstname, lastname} is a candidate key of professors – a unique combination of columns.

It isn't one in affiliations though, because, as said in the video, professors can have more than one affiliation.

Because professors are referenced by professor_id now, the firstname and lastname columns are no longer needed, so it's time to drop them. After all, one of the goals of a database is to reduce redundancy where possible.

Drop the firstname and lastname columns from the affiliations table.

```
-- Drop the firstname column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP COLUMN firstname;

-- Drop the lastname column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP COLUMN lastname;
```

Good job! Now the affiliations table that models the N:M-relationship between professors and organizations is finally complete.
