# 1. Working with data types

Working with data types is straightforward in a database management system like PostgreSQL.

# 2. Working with data types

As said before, data types are attribute constraints and are therefore implemented for single columns of a table. They define the so-called "domain" of values in a column, that means, what form these values can take â€“ and what not. Therefore, they also define what operations are possible with the values in the column, as you saw in the previous exercises. Of course, through this, consistent storage is enforced, so a street number will always be an actual number, and a postal code will always have no more than 6 digits, according to your conventions. This greatly helps with data quality.

# 3. The most common types

Here are the most common types in PostgreSQL. Note that these types are specific to PostgreSQL but appear in many other database management systems as well, and they mostly conform to the SQL standard. The "text" type allows characters strings of any length, while the "varchar" and "char" types specify a maximum number of characters, or a character string of fixed length, respectively. You'll use these two for your database. The "boolean" type allows for two boolean values, for example, "true" and "false" or "1" and "0", and for a third unknown value, expressed through "NULL".

# 4. The most common types (cont'd.)

Then there are various formats for date and time calculations, also with timezone support. "numeric" is a general type for any sort of numbers with arbitrary precision, while "integer" allows only whole numbers in a certain range. If that range is not enough for your numbers, there's also "bigint" for larger numbers.

# 5. Specifying types upon table creation

Here's an example of how types are specified upon table creation. Let's say the social security number, "ssn", should be stored as an integer as it only contains whole numbers. The name may be a string with a maximum of 64 characters, which might or might not be enough. The date of birth, "dob", is naturally stored as a date, while the average grade is a numeric value with a precision of 3 and a scale of 2, meaning that numbers with a total of three digits and two digits after the fractional point are allowed. Lastly, the information whether the tuition of the student was paid is, of course, a boolean one, as it can be either true or false.

# 6. Alter types after table creation

Altering types after table creation is also straightforward, just use the shown "ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN" statement. In this case, the maximum name length is extended to 128 characters. Sometimes it may be necessary to truncate column values or transform them in any other way, so they fit with the new data type. Then you can use the "USING" keyword, and specify a transformation that should happen before the type is altered. Let's say you'd want to turn the "average_grade" column into an integer type. Normally, PostgreSQL would just keep the part of the number before the fractional point. With "USING", you can tell it to round the number to the nearest integer, for example.

# 7. Let's apply this!

Let's apply this to your database and add the proper types to your table columns.

# Change types with ALTER COLUMN

The syntax for changing the data type of a column is straightforward. The following code changes the data type of the column_name column in table_name to varchar(10):
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name
TYPE varchar(10)
```
Now it's time to start adding constraints to your database.

1. Have a look at the distinct university_shortname values in the professors table and take note of the length of the strings.

```
-- Select the university_shortname column
SELECT DISTINCT(university_shortname) 
FROM professors;
```

2. Now specify a fixed-length character type with the correct length for university_shortname.

```
-- Specify the correct fixed-length character type
ALTER TABLE professors
ALTER COLUMN university_shortname
TYPE CHAR(3);
```

3. Change the type of the firstname column to varchar(64).

```
-- Change the type of firstname
ALTER TABLE professors
ALTER COLUMN firstname
TYPE varchar(64);
```

I've specified the types of the other tables for you.

# Convert types USING a function

If you don't want to reserve too much space for a certain varchar column, you can truncate the values before converting its type.

For this, you can use the following syntax:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name
TYPE varchar(x)
USING SUBSTRING(column_name FROM 1 FOR x)
```
You should read it like this: Because you want to reserve only x characters for column_name, you have to retain a SUBSTRING of every value, i.e. the first x characters of it, and throw away the rest. This way, the values will fit the varchar(x) requirement.

Run the sample code as is and take note of the error.
Now use SUBSTRING() to reduce firstname to 16 characters so its type can be altered to varchar(16).

```
-- Convert the values in firstname to a max. of 16 characters
ALTER TABLE professors 
ALTER COLUMN firstname 
TYPE varchar(16)
USING SUBSTRING(firstname FROM 1 FOR 16);
```

However, it's best not to truncate any values in your database, so we'll revert this column to varchar(64). Now it's time to move on to the next set of attribute constraints!
