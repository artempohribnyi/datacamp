# 1. The not-null and unique constraints

In the last part of this chapter, you'll get to know two special attribute constraints: the not-null and unique constraints.

# 2. The not-null constraint

As the name already says, the not-null constraint disallows any "NULL" values on a given column. This must hold true for the existing state of the database, but also for any future state. Therefore, you can only specify a not-null constraint on a column that doesn't hold any "NULL" values yet. And: It won't be possible to insert "NULL" values in the future.

# 3. What does NULL mean?

Before I go on explaining how to specify not-null constraints, I want you to think about "NULL" values. What do they actually mean to you? There's no clear definition. "NULL" can mean a couple of things, for example, that the value is unknown, or does not exist at all. It can also be possible that a value does not apply to the column. Let's look into an example.

# 4. What does NULL mean? An example

Let's say we define a table "students". The first two columns for the social security number and the last name cannot be "NULL", which makes sense: this should be known and apply to every student. The "home_phone" and "office_phone" columns though should allow for null values – which is the default, by the way. Why? First of all, these numbers can be unknown, for any reason, or simply not exist, because a student might not have a phone. Also, some values just don't apply: Some students might not have an office, so they don't have an office phone, and so forth. So, one important take away is that two "NULL" values must not have the same meaning. This also means that comparing "NULL" with "NULL" always results in a "FALSE" value.

# 5. How to add or remove a not-null constraint

You've just seen how to add a not-null constraint to certain columns when creating a table. Just add "not null" after the respective columns. But you can also add and remove not-null constraints to and from existing tables. To add a not-null constraint to an existing table, you can use the "ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL" syntax as shown here. Similarly, to remove a not-null constraint, you can use "ALTER COLUMN DROP NOT NULL".

# 6. The unique constraint

The unique constraint on a column makes sure that there are no duplicates in a column. So any given value in a column can only exist once. This, for example, makes sense for university short names, as storing universities more than once leads to unnecessary redundancy. However, it doesn't make sense for university cities, as two universities can co-exist in the same city. Just as with the not-null constraint, you can only add a unique constraint if the column doesn't hold any duplicates before you apply it.

# 7. Adding unique constraints

Here's how to create columns with unique constraints. Just add the "UNIQUE" keyword after the respective table column. You can also add a unique constraint to an existing table. For that, you have to use the "ADD CONSTRAINT" syntax. This is different from adding a "NOT NULL" constraint. However, it's a pattern that frequently occurs. You'll see plenty of other examples of "ADD CONSTRAINT" in the remainder of this course.

# 8. Let's apply this to the database!

Okay, time now to apply the not-null and unique constraints to some of the columns of your current university affiliations database.

# Disallow NULL values with SET NOT NULL

The professors table is almost ready now. However, it still allows for NULLs to be entered. Although some information might be missing about some professors, there's certainly columns that always need to be specified.

1. Add a not-null constraint for the firstname column.

```
-- Disallow NULL values in firstname
ALTER TABLE professors 
ALTER COLUMN firstname SET NOT NULL;
```

2. Add a not-null constraint for the lastname column.

```
-- Disallow NULL values in lastname
ALTER TABLE professors
ALTER COLUMN lastname SET NOT NULL;
```

It is no longer possible to add professors which have either their first or last name set to NULL. Likewise, it is no longer possible to update an existing professor and setting their first or last name to NULL.

# What happens if you try to enter NULLs?

Execute the following statement:
```
INSERT INTO professors (firstname, lastname, university_shortname)
VALUES (NULL, 'Miller', 'ETH');
Why does this throw an error?
```

This statement violates one of the not-null constraints you've just specified.

# Make your columns UNIQUE with ADD CONSTRAINT

As seen in the video, you add the UNIQUE keyword after the column_name that should be unique. This, of course, only works for new tables:
```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
 column_name UNIQUE
);
```
If you want to add a unique constraint to an existing table, you do it like that:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT some_name UNIQUE(column_name);
```
Note that this is different from the ALTER COLUMN syntax for the not-null constraint. Also, you have to give the constraint a name some_name.

1. Add a unique constraint to the university_shortname column in universities. Give it the name university_shortname_unq.

```
-- Make universities.university_shortname unique
ALTER TABLE universities
ADD CONSTRAINT university_shortname_unq UNIQUE(university_shortname);
```

2. Add a unique constraint to the organization column in organizations. Give it the name organization_unq.

```
-- Make organizations.organization unique
ALTER TABLE organizations
ADD CONSTRAINT organization_unq UNIQUE(organization);
```

Making sure universities.university_shortname and organizations.organization only contain unique values is a prerequisite for turning them into so-called primary keys – the subject of the next chapter!
