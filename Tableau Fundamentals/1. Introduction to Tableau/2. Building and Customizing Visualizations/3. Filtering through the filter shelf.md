# 1. Filtering through the filter shelf

We now have the cellphone and broadband metric in our visualization. Let’s use the show me feature to pick a more suitable visualization like the side-by-side bar graph. Both communication metrics are in the filter card. If we select show filter for both, we can see interactive filter cards on the side. The same can be done with a dimension like country which comes in the form of a checklist. In each interactive filter, you can customize the appearance and if single or multiple values can be selected. You may notice there are null values in our graph. This is misleading because it makes it look like the values are 0 when we just don’t know the actual values of those countries. We can filter out null values by going to the special tab and selecting non-null values. Another useful filter is the TOP filters for dimensions. For example, let’s say we wanted to only show the top 5 countries with the highest cellphone metric average across all years. We go into the top tab to do this. Note that you can also choose bottom instead of top.
