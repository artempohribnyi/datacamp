# 1. Sorting and filtering through selection

Here is a simple horizontal bar graph showing the cell phone metric segmented by country and year. We can sort directly on the view by clicking the headers. Or, we can also use the icons on the tool bar to sort in ascending and descending order. One of the ways to filter is by selection. Letâ€™s say we wanted the top 10 countries in 2006, we highlight the first 10 rows and right click to keep only. Say we only wanted 2015 to 2017, we could select those categories and keep only. You can also choose to exclude, for example filtering out 2015. You can filter at the different levels from the year, the country, to the measure itself. If you look at the filter card, you can see that our filtering is being recorded Dragging these cards away removes the filter. The standard way of filtering is dragging fields to the filter shelf. Dragging a dimension, allows us to check which values we want to see. When dragging a measure, we get an option for aggregation, which we can skip for now. We can specify a range or max/min for values. The defualt values are the actual range in the view currently. For example, I can filter for countries with at most 20 cell phone users per 100 people. We can always edit all these filters back on the filter shelf!
