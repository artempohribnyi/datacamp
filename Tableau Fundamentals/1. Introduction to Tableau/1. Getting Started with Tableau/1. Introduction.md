You will get an understanding of Tableau's fundamental concepts and features: how to connect to data sources, use Tableauâ€™s drag-and-drop interface, and create compelling visualizations. You will explore an Airbnb dataset for the city of Amsterdam.

# 1. Introduction

Welcome to this introductory course on Tableau! My name is Maarten and I will be your first instructor guiding you through your Tableau journey.

# 2. What is Tableau?

Tableau is a powerful and leading data visualization tool. It allows you to intuitively click, drag, and drop data elements to explore and interrogate your data. In other words: Tableau makes it easy to build beautiful, interactive visualizations from raw data.

# 3. Why use Tableau?

While Tableau is designed to be used by a range of business users and non-technical audiences, it also provides access to a deep computational ability for advanced data analytics. It's flexible because you can easily work with a lot of different data sources. In addition, Tableau is quite intuitive: visual cues and icons make the interface easier to navigate. Also, the drag and drop functionality makes prototyping very fast: you can build dashboards in hours or days instead of weeks. Overall, Tableau is great because you can frame the business question you want to answer, import and clean data, analyze and visualize data, make business decisions, and finally, present insights, all within one tool!

# 4. Who uses Tableau?

Tableau enables anyone to ask questions about their data. If you search for "Tableau" on job boards, the most common job titles you'll see are variants of data analyst, business analyst, and analytics consultant. Basically anyone who wants to analyze or visualize data can benefit from using Tableau. Let's look at some examples of what's possible with Tableau.

# 5. Possibilities with Tableau

Presenting sales performance over time and location using an interactive dashboard is a very common example for using Tableau. The user can select, filter, and hover over the various dashboard elements to learn more about the data.

Thirdly, Tableau can also be used to track outbreaks and epidemic progression, like the coronavirus. Factual data is convincing, and visualization is an incredibly efficient way to get your point across - so Tableau can be an appropriate tool in various circumstances.

# 8. Tableau versions

Before we head over to the exercises, let's quickly talk about Tableau versions. Tableau Public is essentially a free version of Tableau. It has most of the software features: you have access to all the available visualizations and can connect to Excel and CSV files. However, you can't load more than 15 million rows and can't save your workbook locally. Your work is stored publicly on Tableau's gallery, so using Tableau public with sensitive data is definitely not recommended. The professional version requires a license, you can create visualizations, connect to all available data sources, add an unlimited amount of rows, and save your work locally. In this course, you will be using Tableau Public. Although you can download Tableau Public on your local machine if you want to, you don't have to install anything to complete this course. Everything, including a virtual machine running Tableau, and the necessary datasets, are available for you online.

# 9. Let's practice!

Got it? Let's see how well you know Tableau.

# What can('t) you do with Tableau?

You've seen some examples of what is possible with Tableau. You've also learned about the differences between Tableau Public, the free version you'll be using in the exercises, and Tableau Desktop, which requires a paid license.

Of the following scenarios, which one is possible with Tableau Public?

Correct! It is perfectly possible to connect to multiple Excel files in a single Tableau Public dashboard. Note that all scenarios would be possible using Tableau Desktop.
